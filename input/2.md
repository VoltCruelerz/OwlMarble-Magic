</div>

<div style='margin-top:-20px'></div>
<div class='classTable'>

### Translocation Rules

A translocation effect is any effect that instantaneously (or at least instantaneously as far as combat is concerned) transports you to a different location.  Translocation effects can be divided into 3 categories: _Portals_, _Teleports_, and _Conveyances_.  A few examples are provided for each.

- **Portals**: any effect where a gateway is created that allows for rapid travel between two points.
  - Arcane Gate
  - Gate
  - Transport via Plants
- **Teleports**: any effect that instantaneously alters a target’s location, as if someone had pulled up the universe’s dev console and done JohnDoe.setLocation(x,y,altitude,plane).
  - Dimension Door
  - Teleport
  - Plane Shift
  - Word of Recall
  - Blink
- **Conveyances**: any effect that causes the target to physically travel to a location at extremely high speed such that it is nearly instant, usually involving some manner of temporary discorporation.
  - Warp Strike
  - Misty Step
  - Blessing of the Raven Queen
  - Tree Stride
  - Fiery Conveyance

</div>

```
```

<div class='classTable'>
### Illusion Rules
- Illusions are divided into _Figments_ and _Glamors_.  An individual illusion spell may have either or both.
- Figments and Glamors, unless otherwise specified, are intangible and immune to all damage and conditions.
3. Figments create a shape in the spellcaster’s design of choice that interacts with and possibly emanates harmless sensory information of one or more types, as specified by the spell.  If enough light, sound, scent, taste, or heat, sufficient to directly harm a creature, is directed at a figment, the effect penetrates the figment and only harmless levels are interacted with by the figment.
- Figments are classified as either creatures or objects for the purpose of targeting, depending on what they appear to be.  A creature that knows a figment is an illusion may always target it as if it were a spell effect.
- Glamors alter the harmless sensory effects associated with a creature, object, or spell effect.
- A creature presented with an illusion assumes the illusion is real until given specific cause to disbelieve.  Seeing the illusion appear in the first place is not cause to disbelieve unless a creature has specific prior knowledge to expect illusions, in which case it disbelieves if its passive Investigation exceeds the spell save DC.
- A creature who questions an illusion can make an Investigation check against the caster's spell save DC as an action.  If the creature succeeds, it knows the illusion for what it is.  The caster of an illusion always knows the illusion for what it is.
- Illusions of animate objects and creatures have an Armor Class equal to the spell save DC of their creator while figments of inanimate objects have an Armor Class of 2.  Creatures that “hit” an insubstantial illusion discover it as such when their attack passes through it.
- Illusions automatically succeed on all saving throws.
- A revealed Figment or Glamor does not dissipate, become faint, sound hollow, or otherwise degrade unless otherwise specified in the spell.
- If a creature has Truesight, the creature automatically knows if there is an illusion in its field of view and can perceive both the illusion and anything hidden by it.  It behaves as if it has already succeeded on the investigation check.
- A Figment or Glamor may be reinforced by shadow material from the Shadowfell and so become semi-real.  Such an illusion becomes known as a Shadow and holds up to physical inspection, taking on all properties of the emulated object or creature, but remains totally controlled by its creator.  Shadows cannot be used as spell components.  If a shadow is reduced to zero hit points, it dissipatess.
