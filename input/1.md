- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
You place a glamor on yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – to look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. 

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the glamor is up to you.

### Dye
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action Ritual
- **Range**: 15 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
Using a finite color palette, you recolor an uncontrolled object with whatever pattern you choose, but the entire surface of the object must be covered by one of the colors in the palette.  A palette color can be partially transparent, in which case it does not fully cover any existing coloration in the target.

The size of the palette is four to the power of one less than the level of the spell slot to cast this.

The spell actually alters the pigmentation of the object, so it cannot be dispelled, though it can later be altered by other castings of this spell.

### Slick
_renamed from Grease_
___
- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of butter or ice)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Wizard
___
You cover a 10-foot square within range in a slippery inert substance such as grease or ice.  The target area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.  When the spell is cast, any creatures within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.  A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
___
**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect an additional 10-foot square.  All target squares created by this spell must be contiguous.

### Image
_renamed from Silent Image_
___
- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
You create a visual figment that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The figment appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration.  It may emit light, but may be no brighter than shedding bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond the bright radius.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

### Longstrider
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bone from a cheetah)
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___
A willing creature you touch has its walking speed increased by 15 and it is immune to endurance running exhaustion for 1 hour.

**Higher Levels**: For each level above 1st that this spell is cast at, you may target one additional creature.

### Parallax Room
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
<div class='footnote'>OwlMarble Magic | 1st Level</div><div class='pageNumber auto'></div>\page
You place a visual glamor on an object within range (such as a rug or an illusion of a rug).  The glamor takes the form of adding apparent depth to an object, such as making a room appear off to the side of a hallway or making a pit seem to appear in the floor.  The glamor and the illusory room within may be any shape you desire, but cannot be larger than 10 feet by 10 feet and the illusory room cannot be more than 20 feet deep.  The parallax room created by this spell may be any solid color of your choice and light interacts with the glamor so as to make the room seem real.  For example, if this spell is used to create a pit, a creature standing at the edge would be able to see all the way down, whereas a creature farther back would not be able to see what is at the bottom of the illusory pit.

For the duration, the interior of the room becomes a valid target location for other illusion spells.  If you apply another casting of this spell to an existing parallax room, you may extend the room by the same rules as before.  When this spell ends for any reason, anything inside it or any parallax rooms that branched off it are safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space outside the terminated glamor.

If this spell is subjected to Illusory Reality, this room and any that branch from it become real and are extradimensional.  If this expires while a creature or real object is inside it, the creature or object is safely shunted outside, as if the spell had ended.
___
**Higher Levels**: When cast with a 6th level spell slot or higher, the room lasts until dispelled.  If when you cast it in this way, you subject it to Illusory Reality, it is real until dispelled.

### Reassemble
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bottle of glue)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
You reassemble the fragments of a destroyed inanimate object that would fit within a 5-foot cube so long as the fragments are not being restrained from returning to the target location and are within 100 feet of target location.  An object repaired by this spell will have 1 hit point and will not be structurally sound.  If the target was an undead or construct, the body will be restored, but it will not be reactivated.
___
**Higher Levels**: For each slot higher than 1st, the side-length of the cube increases by 5 feet.

### Repair
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a wrench)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
You heal an inanimate object or construct for 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
___
**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 1st, this spell heals an additional 1d8.

### Sleep
___
- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.  Roll 8d4, the total of which is the number of hit points of creatures this spell can effect.  Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points.

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or another creature uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.  Subtract each creature’s current hit points from the total before moving onto the next-lowest hit point creature.  If a creature has more remaining hit points than the remaining total, the creature is not affected.

Undead and creatures immune to charms aren’t affected by this spell.
___
**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 5d4 for each slot above 1st.  When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you instead roll an additional 10d4 for each slot above 5th.

### Snapshot
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action Ritual
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: S, M (a piece of paper or parchment)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Bard, Warlock, Wizard
___
You close one eye and blink the other.  The visual field of the eye that is blinked is recorded on the paper used as the material component for this spell.

### Warp Strike
___
- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 15 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard, Ranger, Warlock, Wizard
___
With a burst of speed, you travel via the most direct to a target point you can see within range that is adjacent to a creature, and then immediately make a melee attack with a weapon against that creature.  This attack is made with advantage.  During the movement caused by this spell, opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.
<div class='footnote'>OwlMarble Magic | 1st Level</div><div class='pageNumber auto'></div>\page
___
**Higher Levels**: For every two spell levels above 1st this is cast at, the range increases by 20 feet, and you may make another attack with advantage against the creature.

### Witch Bolt
___
- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a twig from a tree that was struck by lightning)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature or uncontrolled object within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.

Make a ranged spell attack against that target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC).  On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically and reassert the grapple if the creature has escaped. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total cover from you.
___
**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot above 1st.  Additionally, at 3rd level, you may grapple targets that are size Large or smaller without them having advantage to break out due to size difference.  At 5th level, this extends to Huge creatures, which cannot break the grapple automatically due to size difference.  Finally, at 7th level, this extends to Gargantuan creatures.

### Controlled Objects
An object is controlled if it is worn or carried.  Otherwise, it is considered uncontrolled.

### Illusion Rules
- Illusions are divided into _Figments_ and _Glamors_.  An individual illusion spell may have either or both.
- Figments and Glamors, unless otherwise specified, are intangible and immune to all damage and conditions.
3. Figments create a shape in the spellcaster’s design of choice that interacts with and possibly emanates harmless sensory information of one or more types, as specified by the spell.  If enough light, sound, scent, taste, or heat, sufficient to directly harm a creature, is directed at a figment, the effect penetrates the figment and only harmless levels are interacted with by the figment.
- Figments are classified as either creatures or objects for the purpose of targeting, depending on what they appear to be.  A creature that knows a figment is an illusion may always target it as if it were a spell effect.
- Glamors alter the harmless sensory effects associated with a creature, object, or spell effect.
- A creature presented with an illusion assumes the illusion is real until given specific cause to disbelieve.  Seeing the illusion appear in the first place is not cause to disbelieve unless a creature has specific prior knowledge to expect illusions, in which case it disbelieves if its passive Investigation exceeds the spell save DC.
- A creature who questions an illusion can make an Investigation check against the caster's spell save DC as an action.  If the creature succeeds, it knows the illusion for what it is.  The caster of an illusion always knows the illusion for what it is.
- Illusions of animate objects and creatures have an Armor Class equal to the spell save DC of their creator while figments of inanimate objects have an Armor Class of 2.  Creatures that “hit” an insubstantial illusion discover it as such when their attack passes through it.
- Illusions automatically succeed on all saving throws.
- A revealed Figment or Glamor does not dissipate, become faint, sound hollow, or otherwise degrade unless otherwise specified in the spell.
- If a creature has Truesight, the creature automatically knows if there is an illusion in its field of view and can perceive both the illusion and anything hidden by it.  It behaves as if it has already succeeded on the investigation check.
- A Figment or Glamor may be reinforced by shadow material from the Shadowfell and so become semi-real.  Such an illusion becomes known as a Shadow and holds up to physical inspection, taking on all properties of the emulated object or creature, but remains totally controlled by its creator.  Shadows cannot be used as spell components.  If a shadow is reduced to zero hit points, it dissipatess.
