## Appendix

### Cantrip Grades
 At certain character levels, your spellcasting grows more powerful, enhancing many of your cantrips.  These enhanced tiers of power are known as **grades**.

- **Grade 1:** Starting at 1st level, your cantrips can be cast at a maximum of Grade 1, usually only having one damage die.
- **Grade 2:** Starting at 5th level, your cantrips can be cast at a maximum of Grade 2, usually having two damage dice.
- **Grade 3:** Starting at 11th level, your cantrips can be cast at a maximum of Grade 3, usually having three damage dice.
- **Grade 4:** Starting at 17th level, your cantrips can be cast at a maximum of Grade 4, usually having four damage dice.

If a cantrip does not grow in power at higher levels, it cannot be cast at a grade above 1.

Once you have gained the ability to cast a spell at a grade, you can also cast the cantrip at lower grades.  For example, if you are level 11 and know the *Fire Bolt* cantrip, you can cast it at Grade 3 for 3d10 fire damage, Grade 2 for 2d10 fire damage, or Grade 1 for 1d10 fire damage.

### Controlled Objects
An object is controlled if it is worn or carried.  Otherwise, it is considered uncontrolled.

### Illusion Rules
- Illusions are divided into _Figments_ and _Glamors_.  An individual illusion spell may have either or both.
- Figments and Glamors, unless otherwise specified, are intangible and immune to all damage and conditions.
3. Figments create a shape in the spellcaster’s design of choice that interacts with and possibly emanates harmless sensory information of one or more types, as specified by the spell.  If enough light, sound, scent, taste, or heat, sufficient to directly harm a creature, is directed at a figment, the effect penetrates the figment and only harmless levels are interacted with by the figment.
- Figments are classified as either creatures or objects for the purpose of targeting, depending on what they appear to be.  A creature that knows a figment is an illusion may always target it as if it were a spell effect.
- Glamors alter the harmless sensory effects associated with a creature, object, or spell effect.
- A creature presented with an illusion assumes the illusion is real until given specific cause to disbelieve.  Seeing the illusion appear in the first place is not cause to disbelieve unless a creature has specific prior knowledge to expect illusions, in which case it disbelieves if its passive Investigation exceeds the spell save DC.
- A creature who questions an illusion can make an Investigation check against the caster's spell save DC as an action.  If the creature succeeds, it knows the illusion for what it is.  The caster of an illusion always knows the illusion for what it is.
- Illusions of animate objects and creatures have an Armor Class equal to the spell save DC of their creator while figments of inanimate objects have an Armor Class of 2.  Creatures that “hit” an insubstantial illusion discover it as such when their attack passes through it.
- Illusions automatically succeed on all saving throws.
- A revealed Figment or Glamor does not dissipate, become faint, sound hollow, or otherwise degrade unless otherwise specified in the spell.
- If a creature has Truesight, the creature automatically knows if there is an illusion in its field of view and can perceive both the illusion and anything hidden by it.  It behaves as if it has already succeeded on the investigation check.
- A Figment or Glamor may be reinforced by shadow material from the Shadowfell and so become semi-real.  Such an illusion becomes known as a Shadow and holds up to physical inspection, taking on all properties of the emulated object or creature, but remains totally controlled by its creator.  Shadows cannot be used as spell components.  If a shadow is reduced to zero hit points, it dissipatess.
