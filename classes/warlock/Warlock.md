# Warlock

## General features

### Flexible Deals [New]

When you become a warlock, you can choose to become an intelligence-based warlock instead of a charisma-based warlock.  If you do, any time a class feature references your charisma, use your intelligence instead.

### Split Magic [New]

Starting at 5th level, when you cast a damaging cantrip with a grade higher than 1 with a spell attack or that compels a saving throw, you can split the spell’s magic.  Instead of casting the spell at your normal grade, you can rapidly cast it at grade 1 a number of times equal to the grade you normally cast it at.  These castings can share targets, but targets cannot be affected by the secondary effects of the spell more than once.

## Pact Boons

### Pact of the Blade [Updated]

When you accept this pact boon, you gain proficiency in medium armor and shields.

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

If you later surrender this pact boon through the Eldritch Versatility feature, you lose proficiency in medium armor and shields if you have no other source for them.

### Pact of the Flesh [New]

Inspired by u/NotTheSmooze’s Pact of the Skin.

When you accept this pact boon, your patron crafts a new body for you.  The body can be any humanoid species, sex, or appearance.  If your species changes, your traits and ability scores change to reflect this.  Somewhere on your body is the tattooed, scarred, or branded symbol of your patron.  This could be in a prominent location such as your forehead, or hidden somewhere.

In this new body, you gain several benefits:
Your armor class becomes 12 + your Charisma modifier.  If you would wear armor, you can choose to use this armor class instead.  You can still benefit from shields when using this armor class.
You cease aging, and can’t be aged magically.
When you roll hit dice, you automatically heal for the maximum value.
If you have any missing body parts or diseases, they are restored or cured.

The new body may reflect the nature of your patron.

- The Archfey: your appearance might change to reflect a particular season such as Summer or Winter, or you might come to possess unearthly beauty and grace or take on the wrinkled, sagging flesh of a hag.
- The Celestial: Your eyes might glow with a golden light.
- The Fiend: Your skin might turn red or leathery, or you might grow a tail or horns.  Your teeth might sharpen, and your skin might be unusually warm or cold to the touch.
- The Genie: Your body might resemble the elemental nature of your patron, similar to that of a Genasi.
- The Great Old One: You might lose color in your eyes, hair, or skin.  You might never blink again.
- The Librarian: Your skin might take on a paper-white appearance with text scrawled across it.
- The Raven Queen: Your skin might turn gray or whenever you enter bright light your bones might be faintly visible beneath your skin.

If you later surrender this pact boon through the Eldritch Versatility feature, you revert to your original body.

## Patrons

### The Genie

#### Archmage [New Genie Subtype]

While most genies are exactly that, sometimes mortals can rise to such great heights of magic that their power is comparable to the famed wish-granting elementals.

##### Expanded Spell List

| Level | Spells |
|:-----:|:-------|
| 1st | Shield |
| 2nd | Tasha’s Mind Whip |
| 3rd | Slow |

#### Genie’s Vessel [Updated]

##### Genie’s Wrath

Once during each of your turns when you deal damage with an attack roll or cantrip, you can deal extra damage to a target equal to your proficiency bonus. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), cold (marid), or force (archmage).

##### Elemental Gift

Starting at 6th level, you begin to take on characteristics of your patron's kind. You now have resistance to a damage type determined by your patron's kind: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), cold (marid), or force (archmage).

In addition, as a bonus action, you can give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet that lasts for 10 minutes, during which you can hover. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch Invocations

### General Invocations

#### Shrouded Spells [New]

When you cast a spell with a saving throw, you can cause any number of the affected creatures to automatically succeed on the saving throw.

### Pact Boon Invocations

#### Pact of the Blade

##### Blade Vault [Imported]

_Credits to u/NotTheSmoooze_

You can perform the ritual to transform a magic weapon into your pact weapon without breaking your connection with your current pact weapon.  You can store a number of magical weapons in your pact weapon’s extradimensional space equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of two).

##### Living Weapon [Imported]

_Credits to u/NotTheSmoooze_

Your pact weapon develops sentience, which inhabits any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature.  It has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 16.  It shares your patron’s alignment, and can read and speak Common and one other language of your patron’s choice.  While you are touching it, it can communicate telepathically with you.

While holding your pact weapon, it can communicate with you telepathically.  It has hearing and darkvision with a range of 120 feet, and it understands your languages.  In addition, it has proficiencies in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, or Religion.  Your pact weapon shares your proficiency bonus, and it can use the Help action targeting you for checks with skills with which it is proficient.

##### Pact’s Shadow [Imported]

_Credits to u/NotTheSmoooze_

Whenever you summon your pact weapon, you can create a shadow figment in your other hand, provided it doesn’t have the two-handed property.  The copy doesn’t gain the benefit of any of your pact weapon’s magical properties, but you can engage in two-weapon fighting with both weapons, even if they aren’t light, and you can perform somatic components of spells while holding both weapons.

##### Dreadful Edge [New]

_Prerequisite: Level 7_

If you roll initiative without having your pact weapon summoned or drawn, when you first summon or draw it, creatures of your choice within a number of feet equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of their next turns.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid being frightened or charmed while you hold your pact weapon.

##### Blade’s Guard [Updated]

_Credits to u/NotTheSmoooze_

When you summon your pact weapon, you can cause a suit of armor that cannot be removed to manifest on your body if you are not already wearing armor.  You choose the form of this light or medium armor each time you create it, though it always shares a clear aesthetic resemblance to your pact weapon.  You are proficient with this armor while you wear it, and it doesn’t impose disadvantage on Stealth checks.

The armor disappears when your pact weapon is dismissed.

#### Pact of the Chain

##### Superior Familiar [New]

_Prerequisite: Level 5_

Your familiar may take on the form of a Beastial Spirit from the spell Summon Beast, as if cast at 1st level. Alternatively, it can take the form of another spirit, depending on your patron. For spirit types that are normally accessed through higher-level spells, they are considered to be downcast to 1st level, taking the negative effects of summoning them with a higher level spell slot.

- **Archfey**: Fey Spirit
- **Celestial**: Celestial Spirit
- **Genie**: Elemental Spirit
- **Great Old One**: Aberrant Spirit
- **Hexblade**: Shadow Spirit
- **Fiend**: Fiendish Spirit

##### Pack Leader [New]

You gain an additional familiar that must take the form of a CR 0 creature that meets the criteria for your familiars.  You may select this Invocation more than once.  Should you do so, previous familiars granted by this Invocation may have a CR as high as half the maximum CR you can select for your familiar (minimum ¼).  The total CR of all your familiars must be no higher than your Charisma modifier.

###### Chain Vitality [New]

By expending a Pact Magic spell slot as an action, you may restore one of your familiars to full health and summon it if it is not actively summoned.

##### Malleable Familiar [New]

Over the course of 10 minutes in which you must concentrate, as if on a spell, and remain in contact with your familiar, you transform your familiar from its current form to another valid form for you.  If it was missing hit points, they are restored.

Alternatively, you can expend a pact magic slot as an action to instantly perform the transformation.

##### Soul-bound [New]

When you are magically healed and your familiar is within 30 feet of you, your Familiar regenerates half the hit points you do and you can cast spells with a range of Self through the familiar, but when your familiar is destroyed, you receive Psychic damage equal to half its maximum hit points.

#### Pact of the Flesh

##### Innate Weapons [New]

You can use a bonus action to grow a natural weapon from part of your body, which you are proficient with and can use to make melee weapon attacks.  It lasts until you use a bonus action to dismiss it.

Each time you create a natural weapon, you determine its appearance, such as claws or horns, and select an appropriate physical damage type.  On a hit, it deals 1d10 + your Strength modifier, and you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you.

When you cast a spell that requires a melee weapon, such as Green-Flame Blade, you can use a weapon you created with this ability instead of the weapon required by the spell.

##### Fluid Form [New]

_Prerequisite: 5th level_

You can choose to soften your body, allowing you to pass through openings as small as 1 inch without squeezing.

##### Unstoppable Heart [New]

_Prerequisite: 7th level_

You can cast Death Ward on yourself once without expending a spell slot.  You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

##### Malleable Flesh [New]

_Prerequisite: 15th level_

When you complete a long rest, you can select an entirely new body from your patron, with the same restrictions as your original body you received from this pact boon.

##### Endless Vitality [New]

_Prerequisite: 18th level_

At the start of each of your turns, unless you have taken fire or acid damage since the end of your last turn, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.  If your body had been obliterated, such as by the Disintegrate spell, your body reforms standing up with one hit point.  Once you have reformed your body in this way, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

#### Pact of the Talisman

##### Talisman of Manifold Forms [New]

As an action while your talisman is within 30 feet of you, you can transform it into an object of your choosing. The talisman takes the form of a piece of adventuring gear, set of artisan's tools, weapon, or musical instrument. The resulting form's gold value cannot exceed 20 times your proficiency bonus.

As part of a short or long rest, you can spend 1 hour searching your Book of Shadows for knowledge of any specific type of Aberration, Celestial, Fey, Fiend, Elemental, or Undead that you have heard of or seen before, such as vampires or imps.

At the end of this time, you learn one piece of information of your choice about the creature from the below list. Once you have learned two pieces of information about a specific type of creature, you find no more information on that creature in the book.

- Resistances
