## Part 1 - Monk Revisions

As a Monk, you gain the following class features

### Basic Monk Features [Updated]

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per monk level
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Wisdom modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:**  1d8 (or 5) + your Wisdom modifier per monk level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** none
**Weapons:** simple weapons, shortswords
**Tools:** none

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Dexerity
**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth

#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- *(a)* a shortsword or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* a dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- 10 darts

### Unarmored Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

`AC = 10 + DEX + WIS`

### Martial Arts [Updated]

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use Unarmed Strikes and monk weapons, which are shortsowrds and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and monk weapons, for your jump distance, and for Athletics checks.
- You can roll a d4 in place of your normal damage die of your Unarmed Strike.

- When you take the Attack action with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one Unarmed Strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an Unarmed Strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

### Step of the Wind [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, you can take the *Disengage* or *Dash* action as a bonus action on your turn. If you do, your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Ki [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points, determined by your Monk level and shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You begin by knowing *Flurry of Blows*, *Patient Defense*, and a Technique. You learn more ki features when you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until the start of your next turn.

Some of your ki features compel a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

`DC = 8 + PB + WIS`

Some of your ki features with a duration require you to channel ki. Channeled effects consume the specified number of ki points for the duration of the effect at the start of each of your turns.

#### Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two Unarmed Strikes as a bonus action.

#### Patient Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.

#### Techniques

You learn ki-powered Techniques that you can use to augment your attacks. You can only apply a single Technique to an attack, unless otherwise noted.

You learn 1 Technique from the below list and learn additional Techniques at higher Monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. When you increase your Monk level, you can exchange any known Technique for any other for which you meet the prerequisites.

See **Part 2** for the list of Techniques.

### Dedicated Weapon [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

- The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon
- You must be proficient with it
- It must lack the heavy and special properties

### Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

### Ki-Fueled Attack [TCOE]

Starting at 3rd level, if you spend 1 or more ki points as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action on that turn.

### Deflect Missiles [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand, and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, as part of the same reaction, you can make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition. You are considered proficient with this attack, and the missile is considered a monk weapon for the attack. On a hit, the thrown missile deals 1d4.

You can throw a number of missiles equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you have done so, you cannot throw more caught missiles until you finish a short or long rest.

### Monastic Tradition

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th.

See **Part 3** below for the full list of subclasses.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you may take a feat.

You gain additional ability score improvements at higher levels, as shown in the Monk table.

### Slow Fall

Starting at 4th level, you can use your reaction to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to 5 times your Monk level.

### Extra Attack [Updated]

Beginning at 5th level, when you take the Attack action, you can expend ki points to make more attacks. For every 3 ki points you expend in this way, you can make one additional attack as part of the action.

When you would gain this feature, if you already have the Extra Attack feature from another class, you can replace this with a Feat.

> #### Maximum Attack Rate
>
> The levels when the maximum number of attacks a monk can make on a turn (when employing **Extra Attack** and **Flurry of Blows** to their fullest extent) changes are shown in the table below.
>
> | Level | Maximum Ki | Number of Attacks |
> |:-----:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
> | 1     | --         | 2                 |
> | 2     | 1          | 3                 |
> | 7     | 4          | 4                 |
> | 13    | 7          | 5                 |
> | 19    | 10         | 6                 |

### Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 6th level, your Unarmed Strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

### Evasion

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or the *Fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to only take half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only take half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind [Updated]

At 7th level, you gain advantage on saving throws to resist being frightened or charmed.

### Purity of Body

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 13th level, you can learn to touch the ki in the minds of others. You understand all spoken languages, and when you speak, you can choose to be understood by all creatures that understand at least one language.

### Diamond Soul [Updated]

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery over ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend reroll it and take the second result. Once you have used this reroll to succeed on a saving throw, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Timeless Body [Updated]

At 15th level, your ki sustains you even when nature fails. You gain the following benefits:

- You are immune to exhaustion.
- You suffer none of the frailty of old age.
- You can't be aged magically.

### Empty Body [Updated]

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your bonus action to channel 4 ki points to become invisible for 10 minutes. During that time, you have resistance to all damage except force.

Additionally, you can cast the *Astral Projection* spell without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take other creatures with you. Once you have cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Perfect Self [Updated]

At 20th level, your mastery over your physical form is complete.

Any time you would make an ability check or saving throw with Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you can instead make it with Wisdom.

## Part 2 - Techniques [New]

### Level 2 Techniques

#### Block Healing

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend any number of ki points. If the target would heal before the start of your next turn, its healing is reduced by 10 times the number of ki points spent, to a minimum of 0. This reduction is applied to each instance of healing the target receives for the duration.

#### Deny Reactions

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to prevent the target from reacting quickly. Until the end of your next turn, the target cannot take reactions.

#### Disarm

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to attempt to disarm the target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one item of your choice.

#### Discombobulate

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to attempt to disrupt the target's ability to attack. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failure, if the target can make multiple attacks on its turn through the Extra Attack or Multiattack feature, the number of attacks it can make on its next turn is reduced by 1. If the target does not possess either of those features, it instead has disadvantage on the first attack it makes on its next turn. A creature cannot suffer from this effect more than once at a given time.

#### Distant Strike

_Prerequisite: Way of the Sun Soul_

When you make a Radiant Sun Bolt attack, you can expend a ki point to increase its range to 120 feet.

#### Goad

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a melee monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to goad the target into attacking you.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn. This technique ends early if you attack or harm another creature or if a creature other than you harms the target.

#### Lunging Strike

When you make an attack with an Unarmed Strike or a melee monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to increase the reach of the attack by 5 feet.

#### Pacify

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike on your turn, you can expend any number of ki points to attempt to put the creature to sleep, and you can choose to have the attack deal no damage. If the creature has fewer hit points than 5 times the number of ki points expended, it falls asleep for 1 hour, until it takes damage, or until a creature uses its action to shake it awake.

#### Plant Delusion

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to create a phantom image or sound in the target creature's mind, as if by the *Minor Illusion* spell. The delusion lasts until the start of your next turn.

#### Probing Strike

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend up to 8 ki points. For each point spent, you learn one of the following traits of your choice about the target creature:

- damage immunities
- damage resistances
- damage vulnerabilities
- condition immunities
- alignment
- highest saving throw
- lowest saving throw
- surface thoughts and emotional state

#### Shove

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, if the target is Large or smaller, you can expend 1 or more ki points to move the target. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or move 5 feet in a direction of your choice for each ki point expended.

#### Silencing Strike

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to attempt to silence the target. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to form words or the verbal components of spells until the start of your next turn.

#### Sweep the Leg

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, if the target is Large or smaller, you can expend 1 ki point to trip the target. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

#### Tracking Strike

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to leave a mystical trace on the target. For the next hour, you know the direction to the creature and your distance from it.

### Level 5 Techniques

#### All Part of the Plan

_Prerequisite: Way of the Drunken Master_

When you miss with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon, you can expend 2 ki points to reroll the attack.

#### Focused Aim

When you miss with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon, you can expend any number of ki points, increasing the attack roll by 2 for each point expended, potentially turning a miss into a hit.

#### Instant Counter

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point. If the target makes a melee weapon attack before the end of your next turn while within your reach, you can use your reaction to make an Unarmed Strike or attack with a monk weapon against it. This reaction attack can be enhanced by a Technique, and is made before the target hits or misses.

#### Sabotage Defenses

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 2 ki points to flood the target creature's body, causing it to be more susceptible to hostile magic. Until the end of your next turn, when the target makes a saving throw against a spell, it must roll a d4 and subtract that from the result.

#### Siphon Vitality

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 2 ki points to siphon some of the target's life force. You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

#### Stunning Strike

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 2 ki points to attempt to stun the target. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Level 7 Techniques

#### Strike the Soul

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to change the attack's damage type to necrotic, radiant, or psychic.

#### Vanishing Strike

You learn to strike with such speed that your enemy momentarily loses track of your position. When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a melee monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point. If you then immediately move 15 feet or more, you become hidden from the target until the end of your turn or you hit the target again.

#### Vital Strike

_Prerequisite: Way of the Open Hand_

Before you make an Unarmed Strike, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can expend 1 ki point to add +10 to the attack's damage.

### Level 9 Techniques

#### Mark for Death

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 3 ki points to render the target more vulnerable to attacks. Until the start of your next turn, whenever the target takes damage from an Unarmed Strike or weapon attack, the attack's damage is increased by 1d4. This effect does not stack.

### Level 11 Techniques

#### Blindside

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 4 ki points to strike with blinding speed. The target takes additional damage equal to your initiative roll, and your initiative becomes 0 starting at the beginning of the next round.

### Level 15 Techniques

#### Expose the Soul

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 4 ki points to attempt to eject a creature's soul. It must succeed on Charisma saving throw or be paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Maintaining the disconnect between a creature's body and soul is mentally taxing and requires your concentration, as if on a spell. You can maintain this disconnect on multiple creatures at once, but if your concentration is broken, it is broken for all applications of this ability.

#### Killing Stroke

When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend any number of ki points. If the target has fewer hit points than the number of ki points expended multiplied by 10, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or die.

## Part 3 - Monastic Traditions

## Ascendant Dragon

### Draconic Disciple [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you can channel draconic power to magnify your presence and imbue your Unarmed Strikes with the essence of a dragon's breath. You gain the following benefits:

- ***Draconic Presence:*** If you fail a Charisma (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can use your reaction to reroll the check, as you tap into the mighty presence of dragons. Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
- ***Draconic Strike:*** When you damage a target with an Unarmed Strike, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
- ***Tongue of Dragons:*** You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.

### Breath of the Dragon [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons you emulate. When you make an Unarmed Strike or an attack with a monk weapon, you can expend 2 ki points to instead release a burst of draconic energy in either a 30-foot line 5 feet wide or a 20-foot cone.

Select a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

Each creature inside the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your ki save DC, taking 2d6 damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.

When your reach 11th level in this class, the damage increases to 3d6.

### Wings Unfurled [Updated]

Starting at 6th level, when you use *Step of the Wind*, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that last until the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses when you complete long rest.

### Aspect of the Wyrm [Updated]

Beginning at 11th level, the power of your draconic spirit now radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring terror in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can create an aura of draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:

- ***Frightful Presence:*** When you create this aura, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the aura. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your ki save DC or become frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- ***Resistance:*** Choose a damage type when you activate this aura: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You and your allies within the aura have resistance to that damage.

Once you create this aura, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest unless you expend 3 ki to recover the use of this feature.

### Ascendant Aspect [Updated]
