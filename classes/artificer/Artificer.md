### Alchemist

#### Expirimental Elixer [Updated]

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. Select an effect for it from the Experimental Elixers table (below), which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist's supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.

You can create additional experimental elixirs using your action and expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you create the elixir in an empty flask you touch.
