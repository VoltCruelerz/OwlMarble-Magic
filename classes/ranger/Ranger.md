## Class Features

### Hunter's Mark [New]

You know the spell _Hunter's Mark_, which does not count against the number of spells you know, and can cast it at the level of your highest spell slot without expending a spell slot. Once you have cast it in this way, you must complete a Short or Long Rest before casting it in this way again.

### Weapon Mastery [New]

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons with which you are proficient, such as Longbows and Longswords.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change the kinds of weapons you chose.

### Hounding Attacks - 2 [New]

Starting at 2nd level, after you make a weapon attack but before the attack resolves, you can use your reaction to learn the target's armor class. Then, as part of this reaction, you can expend a spell slot to enhance the attack. For each level of the spell slot expended, you receive a +1 bonus to hit and a +1 bonus to critical hit range. These bonuses can turn a normal hit into a critical hit or a miss into a hit.

### Ambush Hunter - 3 [New]

Starting at 3rd level, you can cast _Hunter's Mark_ as a free action, but you cannot cast another leveled spell on the same turn.

At 3rd level, you may attempt to harvest the valuable materials from a slain creature. To do so, you may spend 10 minutes to make a Monster Lore check with DC equal to [10 + CR/2] where CR is the creatureâ€™s Challenge Rating.

- On a success, you acquire an alchemical from the creature, and you cannot gather further components from the same creature. This component is highly volatile and loses its potency quickly. As such, it must be used in Alchemy within 1 hour of gathering.
- On a failure, the alchemical component spoils or is otherwise unsalvageable.
