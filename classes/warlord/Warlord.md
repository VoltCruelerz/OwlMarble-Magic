## Warlord Features

### (Prototype) Weapon Mastery - 9 [New]

> **Note**: while fine for most subclasses, this feels a bit thematically weird on a Tactician, even if the masteries of any weapon a Tactician will actually use _will_ give crowd control.

You gain access to the _Weapon Mastery_ property of 2 types of weapons (such as Longswords and Longbows) with which you are proficient. You can change which weapon types benefit in this way at the end of a Long Rest.

## Subclass - Tactician

### Tactician's Leadership - 1 [New]

> **Note**: While Rallying Mark is far and away the best use of LD, as shown in V1 (below), even if I doubled it, it only becomes very strong, not gamebreaking. That introduces issues with devaluing all other uses for LD though. This change doubles the number of dice but devalues each individual die, making them more granular.

When you take this Presence at 1st level, your _Leadership Dice_ progression changes, as shown in the table below.

| Tactician Level | Pool Size | Die Size | Per-Turn Limit |
| :-------------: | :-------: | :------: | :------------: |
|        1        |     -     |    -     |       -        |
|        2        |   **3**   |  **d4**  |       1        |
|        3        |     4     |    d4    |     **2**      |
|        4        |     6     |    d4    |     **3**      |
|        5        |     7     |    d4    |       3        |
|        6        |     9     |    d4    |     **4**      |
|        7        |    10     |    d4    |       4        |
|        8        |    12     |    d4    |       4        |

|       10        |    15     |    d6    |       5        |
|       11        |    16     |    d6    |       5        |
|       12        |    18     |    d6    |     **6**      |
|       13        |    19     |  **d8**  |       6        |
|       14        |    21     |    d8    |       6        |
|       15        |    22     |    d8    |     **7**      |
|       16        |    24     |    d8    |       7        |
|       17        |    25     | **d10**  |       7        |
|       18        |    27     |   d10    |     **8**      |
|       19        |    28     |   d10    |       8        |

### Tactical Flexibility - 3 [Removed]

> **Note**: We already play with the Bonus Action Conversion rule, so this feature is entirely redundant.

### Tactical Insight - 3 [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you can tactically assess a creature's options. As a Bonus Action, make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by a Charisma (Deception) check against any creature you can see within 60 feet.

On a success, you can see through their tactics, granting one of the following effects:

- **Determine Attack**: You can cause them to have disadvantage on their next attack against a creature that can see or hear you.
- **Predict Movement**: You deduce where they are planning to move on their next turn, giving your allies more time to react to it, making them second-guess their path. Their speed is reduced by 10 until the end of their next turn.
- **Outwit Response**: You can find their openings, negating their ability to use their reaction until the end of their next turn.
- **Expose Weakness**: You can use _Helpful Word_ to grant advantage against that target as part of the bonus action without expending a Leadership Die. If you do expend a die, add it to the d20 roll.

If a creature of sufficient threat (`CR >= 1/8`) is reduced to 0 hit points while afflicted by _Determine Attack_, _Predict Movement_, or _Outwit Response_, you regain one expended _Leadership Die_.

### Expanded Tactics - 11 [New]

You gain the following _Leadership Dice_ features:

- **Scapegoat**: As a Bonus Action expend a _Leadership Die_ and select a willing creature and an enemy, both of which must be within 60 feet of you. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than the target until the end of its next turn.
- **Covering Fire**: When you make a ranged attack at an enemy within 60 feet of you, you can use a _Leadership Die_ to allow an ally of your choice within the same range can use their Reaction to move up to half their speed and take the Hide action.

### Tactical Strike - 11 [Updated]

Starting at 11th level, when you make an attack with a weapon with which you are proficient, you can expend a _Leadership Die_ apply the _Slow_, _Push_, or _Isolate_ mastery to your weapon. You can apply these masteries even if the weapon does not meet the mastery's prerequisite. If you already benefit from a mastery from the weapon, you do not benefit from it for this attack.

If the attack hits, roll the expended die and add it to the weapon's damage.

### Swift Analysis - 15 [New]

> **Note**: at higher levels, this becomes essential in keeping you leadership dice up.

You have a second Bonus Action.

### (Prototype) Spellbane Tactics - 15 [New]

You gain the following _Leadership Dice_ features:

- **Elemental Compensation**: Over the course of 10 minutes, you can spend 2 _Leadership Dice_ to equip a creature you touch with scavengered gear to grant them resistance to one of the following elements for 8 hours: Fire, Cold, Acid, Poison, Lightning, Radiant, or Necrotic.
- **Spell Interdiction**: When an ally is within 5 feet of an enemy that is casting a spell, you can spend any number (up to your per turn limit) of _Leadership Dice_ to order the ally to attack the caster. If the number of dice exceeds the level of the spell, the spell fails.

## Musings

- Tactician feels like it should have more types battlefield control, but the issue is how to make this happen on a muggle...
    - obscurement
        - smokescreens
        - night operations
        - adverse weather
    - difficult terrain/bypassing it
    - cover/attacking enemies with cover
    - camouflage
    - hide action/popping stealthed enemies
    - traps/noticing traps
    - flanking/surviving despite being flanked
    - high ground/assault vs high ground
    - flip the script
    - opportunity attacks/avoiding OAs
    - support battle magic (range?)
    - muck with initiative
    - held actions
- traps are cool and thematic, but PCs are offensive, not defensive
    - if they can be hot-deployed, that's more of a gadget, and we're steering into Artificer/Thief territory
    - maybe if they had something to goad enemies into attacking?
- on-turn agency is the main problem.
    - Tactician should benefit from having allies around, but shouldn't need them for disruption-type abilities
- Tactician is ultimately a dedicated manipulator support, so any new features should further that ideal

### (Musing) Plot the Course - 1 [New]

When an ally within 60 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to increase their speed by 5 feet this turn, during which time they are not slowed by _Difficult Terrain_.

### (Musing) Mercenary Negotiations - 1 [New]

When recruiting Hirelings for combat, you can negotiate half the normal rate.

### (Musing) Covering Fire - 7 [New]

When you make a ranged weapon attack at an enemy within 60 feet of you, an ally of your choice within the same range can use their Reaction to move up to half their speed and take the Hide action.

### (Musing) Survey the Terrain - 7 [New]

> **Note**: _extremely_ powerful, but might feel more like destiny than tactics, and doesn't offer on-turn agency

You are adept at surveying the battlefield and picking up on details others may have missed.

When Initiative is rolled and you are not Surprised, select a number of 5-foot squares on the ground that you can see, up to your Intelligence modifier. These squares cannot touch one another, even diagonally.

These squares become difficult terrain. The DM should incorporate minor changes to the scene's description that would cause the difficult terrain spotted by the Tactician, as if it had always been there. For example, if a square was directly inside a door, the DM might narrate that the entryway was muddy from a storm earlier in the day.

### (Musing) Commander's Strike - 11 [New]

You can use the Push, Sap, Slow, and Topple _Masteries_ on any weapon you are proficient with that supports them, but you may only utilize one per weapon type. You can change what Mastery a weapon type benefits from when you complete a Long Rest.

### (Musing) Demoralizing Strike - 11 [New]

> **Note**: this isn't _bad_, but it's clunky, and it somewhat breaks the theming of a battlefield commander. I'd rather there be some other buff on-assist.

Starting at 11th level, when a creature dies while afflicted with _Rallying Mark_ or _Tactical Insight_, the first time you hit on your following turn, the attack deals additional Psychic damage equal to 2 rolls of your _Leadership Die_.

### (Musing) Battle Formation - 11 [New]

> **Note**: _extremely_ strong, but disliked due to lack of personal agency and clunky to remember.

At the start of each of your turns, select a Battle Formation to apply to your allies that round.

- **Maneuver**: the speed of your allies increases by 10.
- **Conquer**: allies have a +1 bonus to hit.
- **Defend**: allies have a +1 bonus to AC.

### (Musing) Dragon's Vision - 15 [New]

> **Note**: This is mostly a ribbon in practice. I'd love something that punches through fog clouds, but that's pretty much automatically magical, and this is a muggle (sub)class.

You are adept at monitoring the battlefield even when it becomes difficult. You no longer suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to _Light Obscurement_.

### (Musing) Continued Cover - 15 [New]

When a willing creature that can see or hear you within 60 feet of you loses the benefit of cover due to an enemy moving around it, you can use your Reaction to move the creature up to half its speed so that it remains in cover.
