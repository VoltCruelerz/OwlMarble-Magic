## Warlord Features

### (Prototype) Weapon Mastery - 9 [New]

> **Note**: while fine for most subclasses, this feels a bit thematically weird on a Tactician, even if the masteries of any weapon a Tactician will actually use _will_ give crowd control.

You gain access to the _Weapon Mastery_ property of 2 types of weapons (such as Longswords and Longbows) with which you are proficient. You can change which weapon types benefit in this way at the end of a Long Rest.

## Subclass - Tactician

### (Prototype) Tactical Flexibility - 3 [Updated]

> **Note**: this risks flooding the party with temps, but does help Tactician scale autonomously so it doesn't need to donate as many attacks.

You can use your Action for _Rallying Mark_, _Helpful Word_, or _Urgent Orders_. When you do so, their effects are enhanced.

- **Greater Rallying Mark**: As an Action, you can expend a number of _Leadership Dice_ (up to your per turn limit) to rally your allies to attack a hostile creature within 60 feet of you. The next time damage is rolled against that target by an allied creature before the start of your next turn, they can add twice as many _Leadership Dice_ as were expended to the damage roll, and the attacking creature regains the same number of hit points.
- **Greater Urgent Orders**: As an Action, you can expend a number of _Leadership Dice_ (up to your per turn limit) to guide your allies in expeditious action. Target an allied creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Roll twice for each leadership dice expended; the target gains temporary hit points equal to the sum that persist until your nest Short or Long Rest. The target can then immediately use its Reaction to move up to its movement speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
- **Greater Helpful Word**: As an Action, you can spend a _Leadership Die_ to take the Help action, adding its roll to the Helped activity. When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 60 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if your ally can see or hear you.
    - **Greater Expert Instructions**: Starting at 9th level, when a creature benefits from your Help action, it may roll the _Leadership Die_ twice instead of once and add the sum.

### (Prototype) Scapegoat - 11 [New]

You gain the following _Leadership Dice_ features:

- **Scapegoat**: As a Bonus Action expend a _Leadership Die_ and select a willing creature and an enemy, both of which must be within 60 feet of you. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than the target until the end of its next turn.
- **Greater Scapegoat**: As an Action expend a _Leadership Die_ and select a willing creature and an enemy, both of which must be within 60 feet of you. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than the target until the end of its next turn. The first time the target enemy damages a creature during that window, roll the expended die and reduce the damage a target receives by the roll.

### (Prototype) Tactical Strike - 11 [Updated]

Starting at 11th level, when you succeed on a _Tactical Insight_ check against a creature, the next time you or a friendly creature deals damage to it before the start of your next turn, the damage to the creature is increased by 2 rolls of your _Leadership Die_.

### (Prototype) Swift Analysis - 11 [New]

You have a second Bonus Action, which may only be used immediately before your Action, immediately after your Action, or between the Strikes of your Attack Action.

## Musings

- Tactician feels like it should have more types battlefield control, but the issue is how to make this happen on a muggle...
    - obscurement
        - smokescreens
        - night operations
        - adverse weather
    - difficult terrain
    - cover
    - hide action
    - traps
    - flanking
    - high ground
    - camouflage
- traps are cool and thematic, but PCs are offensive, not defensive
    - if they can be hot-deployed, that's more of a gadget, and we're steering into Artificer/Thief territory
    - maybe if they had something to goad enemies into attacking?
- on-turn agency is the main problem.
    - Tactician should benefit from having allies around, but shouldn't need them for disruption-type abilities
- Tactician is ultimately a dedicated manipulator support, so any new features should further that ideal

### (Musing) Plot the Course - 1 [New]

When an ally within 60 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to increase their speed by 5 feet this turn, during which time they are not slowed by _Difficult Terrain_.

### (Musing) Mercenary Negotiations - 1 [New]

When recruiting Hirelings for combat, you can negotiate half the normal rate.

### (Musing) Covering Fire - 7 [New]

When you make a ranged weapon attack at an enemy within 60 feet of you, an ally of your choice within the same range can use their Reaction to move up to half their speed and take the Hide action.

### (Musing) Survey the Terrain - 7 [New]

> **Note**: _extremely_ powerful, but might feel more like destiny than tactics, and doesn't offer on-turn agency

You are adept at surveying the battlefield and picking up on details others may have missed.

When Initiative is rolled and you are not Surprised, select a number of 5-foot squares on the ground that you can see, up to your Intelligence modifier. These squares cannot touch one another, even diagonally.

These squares become difficult terrain. The DM should incorporate minor changes to the scene's description that would cause the difficult terrain spotted by the Tactician, as if it had always been there. For example, if a square was directly inside a door, the DM might narrate that the entryway was muddy from a storm earlier in the day.

### (Musing) Commander's Strike - 11 [New]

You can use the Push, Sap, Slow, and Topple _Masteries_ on any weapon you are proficient with that supports them, but you may only utilize one per weapon type. You can change what Mastery a weapon type benefits from when you complete a Long Rest.

### (Musing) Demoralizing Strike - 11 [New]

> **Note**: this isn't _bad_, but it's clunky, and it somewhat breaks the theming of a battlefield commander. I'd rather there be some other buff on-assist.

Starting at 11th level, when a creature dies while afflicted with _Rallying Mark_ or _Tactical Insight_, the first time you hit on your following turn, the attack deals additional Psychic damage equal to 2 rolls of your _Leadership Die_.

### (Musing) Battle Formation - 11 [New]

> **Note**: _extremely_ strong, but disliked due to lack of personal agency and clunky to remember.

At the start of each of your turns, select a Battle Formation to apply to your allies that round.

- **Maneuver**: the speed of your allies increases by 10.
- **Conquer**: allies have a +1 bonus to hit.
- **Defend**: allies have a +1 bonus to AC.

### (Musing) Dragon's Vision - 15 [New]

> **Note**: This is mostly a ribbon in practice. I'd love something that punches through fog clouds, but that's pretty much automatically magical, and this is a muggle (sub)class.

You are adept at monitoring the battlefield even when it becomes difficult. You no longer suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to _Light Obscurement_.

### (Musing) Continued Cover - 15 [New]

When a willing creature that can see or hear you within 60 feet of you loses the benefit of cover due to an enemy moving around it, you can use your Reaction to move the creature up to half its speed so that it remains in cover.
