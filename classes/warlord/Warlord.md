# Warlord

## Warlord Features

### (Prototype) Plot the Course - 3 [New]

When an ally starts to move, you can use your reaction to increase their speed by 5 feet. If your ally moves through difficult terrain as part of that movement, they are not slowed by it.

## Subclasses

### Tactician

### (Prototype) Survey the Terrain - 3 [New]

You are adept at surveying the battlefield and picking up on details others may have missed.

When Initiative is rolled and you are not Surprised, select a number of 5-foot squares on the ground that you can see, up to your Intelligence modifier. These squares cannot touch one another, even diagonally.

These squares become difficult terrain. The DM should incorporate minor changes to the scene's description that would cause the difficult terrain spotted by the Tactician, as if it had always been there. For example, if a square was directly inside a door, the DM might narrate that the entryway was muddy from a storm earlier in the day.

### (Prototype) Dragon's Vision - 3 [New]

You are adept at monitoring the battlefield even when it becomes difficult. You no longer suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to _Light Obscurement_.

### (Prototype) Battle Formation - 3 [New]

At the start of each of your turns, select a Battle Formation to apply to your allies that round.

- **Maneuver**: the speed of your allies increases by 10.
- **Conquer**: allies have a +1 bonus to hit.
- **Defend**: allies have a +1 bonus to AC.
