# Warlord

## Warlord Features

### (Prototype) Weapon Mastery - 9 [New]

> **Note**: while fine for most subclasses, this feels a bit thematically weird on a Tactician, even if the masteries of any weapon a Tactician will actually use _will_ give crowd control.

You gain access to the _Weapon Mastery_ property of 2 types of weapons (such as Longswords and Longbows) with which you are proficient. You can change which weapon types benefit in this way at the end of a Long Rest.

## Subclass - Tactician

### (Prototype) Plot the Course - 1 [New]

When an ally within 60 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to increase their speed by 5 feet this turn, during which time they are not slowed by _Difficult Terrain_.

### (Prototype) Tactical Flexibility - 3 [Updated]

> **Note**: this risks flooding the party with temps, but does help Tactician scale autonomously so it doesn't need to donate as many attacks.

Additionally at 3rd level, you can use your Action for _Tactical Insight_, _Rallying Mark_, _Helpful Word_, or _Urgent Orders_. When you do so and roll a _Leadership Die_, you may roll the die twice instead of once and take the sum.

Starting at 11th level, you may roll the die 3 times instead. At 17th level, you may roll it 4 times instead.

### (Prototype) Survey the Terrain - 7 [New]

> **Note**: _extremely_ powerful, but might feel more like destiny than tactics, and doesn't offer on-turn agency

You are adept at surveying the battlefield and picking up on details others may have missed.

When Initiative is rolled and you are not Surprised, select a number of 5-foot squares on the ground that you can see, up to your Intelligence modifier. These squares cannot touch one another, even diagonally.

These squares become difficult terrain. The DM should incorporate minor changes to the scene's description that would cause the difficult terrain spotted by the Tactician, as if it had always been there. For example, if a square was directly inside a door, the DM might narrate that the entryway was muddy from a storm earlier in the day.

### (Prototype) Red Herring - 11 [New]

> **Note**: I like the idea of this, but not the implementation. Needs refining.

As a Bonus Action or in place of an Attack, select a willing creature and enemy, both of which must be within 60 feet of you. The enemy must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than the target until the end of its next turn.

### (Prototype) Battle Formation - 11 [New]

> **Note**: _extremely_ strong, but disliked due to lack of personal agency and clunky to remember.

At the start of each of your turns, select a Battle Formation to apply to your allies that round.

- **Maneuver**: the speed of your allies increases by 10.
- **Conquer**: allies have a +1 bonus to hit.
- **Defend**: allies have a +1 bonus to AC.

### (Prototype) Demoralizing Strike - 11 [New]

> **Note**: this isn't _bad_, but it's clunky, and it somewhat breaks the theming of a battlefield commander. I'd rather there be some other buff on-assist.

Starting at 11th level, when a creature dies while afflicted with _Rallying Mark_ or _Tactical Insight_, the first time you hit on your following turn, the attack deals additional Psychic damage equal to 2 rolls of your _Leadership Die_.

### (Prototype) Tactical Strike - 11 [Updated]

> **Note**: 1d6 extra isn't a ton, but it isn't nothing either.

Starting at 11th level, when you succeed on a _Tactical Insight_ check against a creature, the next time you or a friendly creature deal damage against it before the start of your next turn, the damage to the creature is increased by 2 rolls of your _Leadership Die_.

### (Prototype) Dynamic Tools - 11 [New]

> **Note**: pushes Tactician more toward a tinkerer playstyle by chucking out gizmos and potions

You have a second Bonus Action.

### (Prototype) Dynamic Tools - 11 [New]

> **Note**: pushes Tactician more toward a tinkerer playstyle by chucking out gizmos and potions

You have a second Bonus Action.

### (Prototype) Dragon's Vision - 15 [New]

> **Note**: This is mostly a ribbon in practice. I'd love something that punches through fog clouds, but that's pretty much automatically magical, and this is a muggle (sub)class.

You are adept at monitoring the battlefield even when it becomes difficult. You no longer suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to _Light Obscurement_.

### Musings

- Tactician feels like it should have more types battlefield control. Smokescreens, difficult terrain, and the like.
    - the issue is how to make this happen on a muggle...
- traps are cool and thematic, but PCs are offensive, not defensive
    - if they can be hot-deployed, that's more of a gadget, and we're steering into Artificer/Thief territory
    - maybe if they had something to goad enemies into attacking?
- on-turn agency is the main problem.
    - Tactician should benefit from having allies around, but shouldn't need them for disruption-type abilities
- Tactician is ultimately a dedicated manipulator support, so any new features should further that ideal
