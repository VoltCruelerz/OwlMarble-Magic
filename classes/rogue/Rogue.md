# Rogue

## General Changes

### Sneak Attack [Updated]

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. When you hit with an attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon, and once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until the start of your next turn.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Doubled Up [New]

When you engage in [two-weapon fighting](../../rules/combat/Two-Weapon%20Fighting.md) with light melee weapons, you add your proficiency bonus to the attack rolls.

### Cunning Action [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Aim, Blind, Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Tuck and Roll [New]

When you reach 5th level, when you take fall damage, you can use your reaction to instead take half damage. If you are still reduced to 0 hit points, you remain unconscious but stabilize.

### Reliable Talent [Updated]

By 11th level, you have refined your skills until they approach perfection.  Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.  Additionally, you can treat a Sneak Attack die roll of a 2 or lower as a 3.

## Subclass Changes

### Assassin

#### Isolation [New]

Starting at 3rd level, if a creature does not have an ally within 5 feet of it, you can use your Sneak Attack against it as long as you do not have disadvantage.

#### Brutal Critical [New]

Starting at 13th level, when you score a critical hit, you add another die of damage.

### Mastermind

#### Master of Tactics [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a Bonus Action.  Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be up to 30 feet away from you.  Additionally, instead of providing advantage on the first attack they make on their turn against the creature, they gain advantage on all attacks against the creature that they make as part of their first attack action on their next turn.

#### Commanding Presence [New]

Starting at 9th level, while helping an ally with your Master of Tactics feature, your ally's critical hit range increases by one foiurth your Rogue level, rounded down.
