## Sneak Attack [Updated]

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. When you hit with an attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon, and once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until the start of your next turn.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

## Doubled Up [New]

You can utilize the _Nick_ Mastery on any weapon that meets the Mastery's prerequisites.

## Cunning Action - 2 [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Aim, Blind, Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

## Ready for Anything - 2 [New]

Starting at 2nd level, you are always on the lookout for the next encounter. When you roll Initiative, add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

## Tuck and Roll - 5 [New]

When you reach 5th level, when you take fall damage, you can use your reaction to instead take half damage. If you are still reduced to 0 hit points, you remain unconscious but stabilize.

## Reliable Talent - 11 [Updated]

By 11th level, you have refined your skills until they approach perfection.  Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.  Additionally, you can treat a Sneak Attack die roll of a 2 or lower as a 3.

When you reach 15th level, an ally within 5 feet of you that you can see making a check you are proficient in can also treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

## Subtle Strikes - 14 [Updated]

By 14th level, you know how to exploit a target's distractions. When a creature within your reach gets up from prone or picks up an item, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you, and you can apply Sneak Attack to the attack, provided you do not have disadvantage.

## Stroke of Luck - 17 [Updated]

At 17th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. After making an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, before the roll resolves, you may choose to change the d20's result to a natural 20.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a Short or Long Rest unless you take a level of Exhaustion.

## Subclasses

### Assassin

#### Isolation - 3 [New]

Starting at 3rd level, if a creature does not have an ally within 5 feet of it, you can use your Sneak Attack against it as long as you do not have disadvantage.

#### Brutal Critical - 13 [New]

Starting at 13th level, when you score a critical hit, you add another die of damage.

#### Death Strike - 17 [Updated]

Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature that is Incapacitated or Surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.

### Inquisitive

#### Eye for Weakness - 17

At 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature's weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. When  your Insightful Fighting feature is applied to a creature, you learn its Creature Type, Immunities, Resistances, and Vulnerabilities.

Additionally, your Sneak Attack damage against that creature increases by a number of d6s equal to your Intelligence modifier while the feature is applied.

### Mastermind

#### Master of Tactics - 3 [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a Bonus Action, and when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be up to 30 feet away from you.

Additionally, instead of providing advantage on the first attack they make on their turn against the creature, they gain advantage on all attacks against the creature that they make as part of their first attack action on their next turn.

#### Commanding Presence - 9 [New]

Starting at 9th level, while helping an ally with your Master of Tactics feature, your ally's critical hit range increases by one fourth your Rogue level, rounded down.

| Level | Bonus |
| :---: | :---: |
|   9   |   2   |
|  12   |   3   |
|  16   |   4   |
|  20   |   5   |

#### Forward Planning - 17 [New]

Starting at level 17, the radius in which your allies can benefit from _Reliable Talent_ increases to 30 feet.

### Scout

#### Superior Mobility - 9 [Updated]

At 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.

Additionally, as an Action, you can gain two additional Bonus Actions for use on your turn.
