## Base Fighter

### Extra Attack [Updated]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and four when you reach 17th level.

When you would gain this feature, if you already have the Extra Attack feature from another class, you can replace this with a Feat.

### Indomitable [Updated]

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail.  Once you succeed on a saving throw using this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Starting at 13th level, you can succeed on two saving throws using this feature between long rests, and at 17th level, this increases to three.

### Perfected Form [New]

At 20th level, your skill with your weapons becomes unparalleled.  When you make an attack with a weapon and roll less than a 10 on the d20, you can treat it as a 10.

## Subclasses

### Echo Knight

The echo counts for flanking.
