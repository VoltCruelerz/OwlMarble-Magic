## Weapon Mastery - 1 [Updated]

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change the kinds of weapons you chose.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter table.

Furthermore, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can choose one of the kinds of Mastery weapons you’re using and replace its Mastery property with another Mastery property. The chosen kind of weapon must qualify for the new property. For example, you could replace the Longsword’s _Flex_ property with the _Push_ property.

This property change applies only for you, not for others.

## Second Wind - 1 [Updated]

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

The healing dice of this ability increases at higher levels.

- Level 5: 2d10 (`2d10+level`=`11+5`=`16`)
- Level 11: 3d10 (`3d10+level`=`16.5+11`=`27.5`)
- Level 17: 4d10 (`4d10+level`=`22+17`=`39`)

## Extra Attack - 5 [Updated]

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and four when you reach 17th level.

When you would gain this feature, if you already have the Extra Attack feature from another class, you can replace this with a Feat.

## Weapon Expert - 7 [Updated]

Starting at 7th level, when you use your Weapon Expert feature on a kind of weapon, you can give that kind of weapon two properties rather than one, but you then use only one property at a time; whenever you make an attack roll against a target with that kind of weapon, you decide which of the two properties applies to that attack.

You make this decision before the attack hits or misses. For example, you could apply the Push and Topple properties to Longswords, and whenever you hit a target with a Longsword, you decide which of those properties to use against the target.

## Indomitable - 9 [Updated]

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail.  If you succeed, until you complete a long rest, if you use this ability again and you succeed on that saving throw, you take a level of Exhaustion.

Starting at 13th level, you can succeed on two saving throws using this feature between long rests without exhaustion.

## Power Attack - 11 [New]

Starting at 11th level, when you make an attack roll with a weapon, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to hit. If you then hit with the attack, the target takes additional damage of the weapon's type equal to half your Fighter level.

## Weapon Adept - 13 [Updated]

Starting at 13th level, you can ignore the prerequisites of Masteries when assigning Masteries to a weapon.

## Unconquerable - 17 [Updated]

Starting at 17th level, when you’re in great peril, you can tap into a deep well of resilience within yourself. When you use your Indomitable feature, you automatically succeed on the saving throw.

## Perfected Form - 19 [New]

When you make an attack with a weapon that has two Masteries, you can apply both effects to the target, and you choose the order of application when you make the attack.

The echo counts for flanking.

### Champion

#### Adaptable Warrior - 3 [New]

You’ve studied your friends and foes alike and learned that victory relies on adaptability. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can gain proficiency in one skill from those available to this class at 1st level, as you remind yourself of past lessons. This proficiency lasts until the end of your next Long Rest.

Additionally, you can add half your proficiency bonus to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you are not proficient in.

#### Improved Critical - 3 [Unchanged]

Your critical critical success range for attacks and Death Saving Throws increase by 1. This bonus increases at higher levels.

#### Additional Fighting Style - 7 [New]

You gain another Fighting Style of your choice.

#### Heroic Warrior - 6 [New]

Once per Encounter, you can give yourself a charge of Heroic Inspiration if you don't already have a charge, and your jump distance increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

#### Reputation - 10 [New]

When you would make an ability check using Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using Strength or Dexterity and people that do not have opposed alignments to yours will be willing to shelter you for the night, provided there is no danger to them.

#### Survivor - 14 [Updated]

You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle, granting you the following benefits:

- **Defy Death**: You have advantage on Death Saving Throws.
- **Heroic Rally**: At the start of each of your turns where you have at least 1 hit point, you regain Hit Points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier, up to half your maximum.
