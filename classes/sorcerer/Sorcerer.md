> Eagle-eyed observers may notice that the mana points provided in this table is equal to the default Sorcerer’s number of sorcery points plus the number of Spell Points granted by the Spell Points variant feature from the DMG.  Likewise, maximum mana slot level is also derived from the Spell Points system.

## Spellcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of an ancestor, left an indelible mark on you,  infusing you with arcane magic.  This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

### Cantrips

At first level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.  You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.  When you increase your sorcerer level, you may trade any or all of your cantrips for others from the sorcerer list.

### Mana

Other spellcasters that rely on pre-packaged bundles of magic, but you tap into a wellspring of magic within yourself that grants you greater control of magic than other mages will ever know.  

Instead of spell slots, you have a reservoir of magic within you that is represented by Mana Points, but you are considered to have spell slots of the levels you are able to cast, as defined in the Sorcerer class table above, for the purpose of accessing features that require access to spell slots.

You have 4 mana points, and you gain additional points when you increase your sorcerer level, as shown in the Sorcerer class table above.

If you have more spellcasting levels in other classes than you do in sorcerer, use the default rules from the PHB for the _Spellcasting and Font of Magic_ features instead of this feature and _Font of Mana_ (below).  If you have more sorcerer levels than other spellcasting levels, you lose any spell slots granted by those classes, and instead count the spellcasting levels of those classes toward your sorcerer level when determining your maximum number of mana points.

#### Slot Synthesis

When you wish to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you expend mana points to momentarily construct a spell slot of the desired level to package the raw magic, as specified in the table below.  The maximum spell level you can construct is specified in the Sorcerer class table.  You cannot reduce your mana points below 0, and you regain all mana points when you complete a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast.  When you create a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you may not create another slot of that level until you complete a long rest.

| Slot Level | Mana Point Cost |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
|    1st     |        2        |
|    2nd     |        3        |
|    3rd     |        5        |
|    4th     |        6        |
|    5th     |        7        |
|    6th     |        9        |
|    7th     |       10        |
|    8th     |       11        |
|    9th     |       13        |

## Font of Mana - 2 [New]

At 2nd level, you gain additional uses for your mana points that do not require casting a spell.

### Imbuing Touch

As an action, you can touch one nonmagical weapon and spend 2 mana points to imbue it with magic for 1 minute.  For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

### Sorcerous Fortitude

As an action, you can spend any number of mana points up to your sorcerer level to roll a d4 for each point expended.  You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled that last until the end of your next long rest.

## Flexible Magic - 3 [Updated]

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist magic to suit your needs.  You gain two Metamagic options, detailed at the end of this document.  You gain another Metamagic option of your choice at 10th level, and a final one at 17th level.  When you gain a level in Sorcerer, you can replace any or all of your Metamagic selections with new ones except for your origin Metamagics, detailed below.

You can only use one metamagic option on a spell unless otherwise noted.

### Origin Metamagic - 3 [New]

Starting at 3rd level, in addition to your Metamagic selections, your sorcerous origin lends itself to twisting your spells in certain ways.  The metamagics in the corresponding table below are known automatically by you starting at the prescribed levels and cannot be traded when you increase your sorcerer level.  They do not count against your number of metamagics known.  If you already have a metamagic when it becomes known to you through your origin, your known metamagic is freed and you may select another.

## Metasorcery - 20 [New]

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended mana points when you finish a short rest.  Additionally, the mana point price of the first metamagic you apply to a spell is reduced by 1.

> Mana points and sorcery points have a 1:1 relationship, so the change here is the price reduction.

## Metamagic Options

### Accelerating Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that targets one or more creatures or vehicles, you can spend 1 mana point to increase the speed of the targets of the spell by 10 until the end of your next turn.  During this time, their movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

### Annihilating Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you may spend a mana point to create a rending magical aura.  Any creatures or nonmagical objects that are reduced to 0 hit point by the spell are annihilated, bursting into specks of light before vanishing and leaving no trace.  When using this metamagic to annihilate a creature, any nonmagical objects it wears or carries are annihilated as well.

### Blinding Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that includes an attack roll, you may spend 2 mana points to imbue the spell with a blinding radiance.  When a creature is hit by an attack roll from the spell, it is blinded until the end of your next turn.

### Careful Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force.  To do so, you spend 1 mana point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 creature).  A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage.

### Disrupting Spell [New]

When you cast a spell, by expending 2 mana points, you can compel all affected creatures to immediately make a Concentration check against your spell save DC.

### Distant Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 mana point to increase the range of the spell by 30 times your sorcerer level.

When you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 mana point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

### Distracting Spell [New]

When you cast a spell, by expending 2 mana points, you can imbue it with an illusory effect that draws the attention of creatures affected by it, distracting them from other nearby dangers.  Once a creature is struck by a spell attack from the spell or fails its initial saving throw against the spell, the next attack roll against it by a creature other than you before the beginning of your next turn has advantage.

### Echoing Spell [New]

When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage in an area of effect without secondary effects, you can spend a number of mana points equal to the spell’s level to cause the energy of the spell to linger.  At the start of your next turn, the lingering spell’s damage applies again to the same area, imposing any corresponding saving throws or making any relevant attack rolls.  Creatures damaged by the echo receive only half damage.  For instance, if the spell would ordinarily include a saving throw for half damage, a creature that succeeds on the echo’s saving throw would receive a quarter of the original damage.

### Empowered Spell [SRD]

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 mana point to reroll a number of dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).  You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 mana point to give yourself advantage on concentration checks to maintain the spell. If the spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you double its duration, to a maximum of 24 hours.

### Gruesome Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can cause the wounds it causes to be especially heinous by expending 3 mana points.  Creatures within 10 feet of a creature when the creature is damaged by the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Harvesting Spell [New]

When you cast a damage-dealing spell, you may expend 2 mana points to link the life force of the targets to your own.  For each small or larger creature damaged by the spell, you gain 1d4 temporary hit points, to a maximum of twice your sorcerer level, that last until the end of your next long rest.

If the spell has damage-dealing effects that are not instantaneous, a creature can only be harvested once, and if additional creatures are later harvested by the spell, the temporary hit points gained from them are added to any remaining temporary hit points from this effect.

The temporary hit points provided by different uses of this metamagic do not stack.

### Heightened Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 2 mana points to give the creature disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.

### Helping Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature at the spell’s current level, you may expend 2 mana points to assist that creature.  Until the end of the creature’s next turn, the creature has advantage on any attack rolls or ability checks it makes.

### Obscuring Spell [New]

When you cast an instantaneous spell with an area of effect, you may expend 2 mana points to create magical darkness in its wake that fills the same area of effect and lasts until the start of your next turn.  For the purpose of removing it, the magical darkness is considered to be of a level equal to the level of the spell that was cast.

### Penetrating Spell [New]

When you cast a damaging spell that targets only one creature, you may spend 3 mana points to attempt to overwhelm its innate defenses. If the creature has resistance to the damage type of the spell, it loses that resistance until the end of your next turn, including against the damage of the triggering spell.

### Quickened Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 mana points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a spell of 1st level or higher on the current turn, nor can you cast a spell of 1st level or higher spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

### Reinforcing Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and that creature is not you, you may expend a number of mana points up to half your sorcerer level, rounded down.  For each mana point expended, the creature gains 1d4 temporary hit points.

### Repulsive Spell [New]

When you cast an instantaneous leveled spell with an area of effect and an initial saving throw, you can spend 2 mana points to unleash a shockwave along with the other effects of the spell. Creatures that fail the initial saving throw of the spell are pushed directly away from the origin of the area of effect.  If a creature encounters an obstacle along the way, their movement stops and they receive no damage. The distance they are pushed is equal to 5 times the spell level, but may not be pushed beyond the edge of the area of effect.  The shockwave can be heard to a number of feet equal to 100 times the spell level.

### Rupturing Spell [New]

When you cast a spell with an area of effect, you may spend 1 mana point to cause the area to become difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

### Scanning Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature at the spell’s current level, you may expend 1 mana point to learn one of the following traits of the creature:

- Armor Class
- Proficient Skills
- Strongest Saving Throw
- Weakest Saving Throw
- Alignment
- Hit Dice Count

You may apply this metamagic to a spell even if you have already applied a metamagic to the same spell.

### Scarring Spell [New]

When you cast a damage-dealing spell, you may expend 1 mana point to cause the wounds it creates to resist healing.  A creature that receives damage from the spell cannot heal until the end of your next turn.  You may apply this metamagic to a spell even if you have already applied another to the same spell.

### Scourging Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that deals damage, you may spend 2 mana points to change the spell’s element to Radiant or Necrotic, or you may expend 3 mana points to change the spell’s element to Force.

### Secret Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that does not summon a creature or turn one creature into another, you may spend 2 mana points to cause any products of the spell to be invisible for the duration of the spell.

### Seeking Spell [TCOE]

When you cast a spell that requires a spell attack or forces a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 mana point to ignore the effects of partial cover.

### Shielding Spell [New]

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature at the spell’s current level, you may expend 1 mana point to give the creature half cover against all attacks and dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn.

### Snaking Spell [New]

When you cast a line spell, you may spend a mana point to add a single bend along the length of the line to change its direction up to 90 degrees. You may apply this metamagic more than once, but each time you do so, the cost increases by 1, and sequential bends may be no closer together than the width of the line.

### Subtle Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 mana point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components, as well as any material components that do not have a gold cost.

### Swarming Spell [New]

When you cast Magic Missile or an instantaneous spell with one or more ranged spell attacks made on the same turn with no secondary effects, you may pay the mana cost of the spell a second time to create twice as many bolts of energy; using this with a cantrip costs 1 mana point.

Half of the attacks behave as normal for the spell, while the other half fire at the beginning of your next turn unless you have been incapacitated.  If a target no longer meets the targeting requirements for the spell, bolts targeting it deal no damage.  You select the targeting of each attack when you initially cast the spell.

### Transmuted Spell [TCOE]

When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can expend 1 mana point to choose a different element from that list.

### Twinned Spell [SRD]

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of mana points equal to the spell’s level (cantrips count as 1) to target a second creature in range with the same spell.

To be eligible, the spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level.  For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray aren’t eligible, but Ray of Frost and Chromatic Orb are.

### Unerring Spell [TCOE]

When you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 mana points to reroll the attack roll.  You can use this metamagic even if you have already used metamagic on the same spell.  If the spell has multiple attack rolls, you apply this metamagic individually for each attack roll.

## Sorcerous Origins

### Abyssal Bloodline [New]

Your innate magic comes from the untameable chaos and fury of the Abyss.  You might have a demonic ancestor or endured a ritual performed by a demonic cult that granted you a sliver of their dark lord’s power.  Perhaps you once fell through a portal to that dread realm, or maybe it was even a willing voyage.  Whatever the cause, this magic within you hungers for release in whatever way it can achieve.

#### Contact Magic [New]

Starting when you choose this Sorcerous Origin at 1st level, your Sorcerer spells have their ranges reduced to 5 feet unless the range is already Touch or Self or the spell causes you to make a melee spell attack.  If the spell causes you to make a ranged spell attack, it instead becomes a melee spell attack.

When you cast a damaging Sorcerer spell in which you make a melee spell attack, you may add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to the attack’s damage roll the first time each affected creature is damaged by your spell.  A creature cannot receive this extra damage more than once per turn.

If you cast a cantrip that causes you to make a melee spell attack that can affect only one creature and has multiple damage dice, you can split the spell’s magic.  Make a number of attacks equal to the number of dice of the cantrip.  On a hit, the target suffers damage of the spell’s type equal to a single damage die, as well as any secondary effects of the spell.  The attacks can target the same or different creatures.

#### Abyssal Shroud [New]

Starting at 1st level, When you damage a creature with a melee attack from a Sorcerer spell you cast, your magic siphons away some of the target’s vitality, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) plus the spell’s level (cantrips count as 0).  These temporary hit points last until the beginning of your next turn.

Additionally, if you are forced to make a saving throw against your own spell, you succeed on the saving throw automatically.

> **Contact Magic** plus **Abyssal Shroud** means Abyssal Sorcerer spells can behave very differently from their defaults.  Here are a few examples:
>
> - **Shocking Grasp:** would deal bonus damage from your Charisma modifier and would grant you temporary hit points.  At higher levels, this could deal 1d8+CHA to multiple creatures and remove all their reactions.
> - **Fire Bolt:** would attack as a melee spell attack with a range of five feet, adding your Charisma modifier to the damage and granting temporary hit points.  Again, at higher levels, this could target multiple creatures.
> - **Green-Flame Blade:** GFB would not gain bonus damage from your Charisma modifier, but it _would_ recharge your shroud.
> - **Fireball:** rather than having a range of 150 feet, the range would drop to 5 feet, but the radius would remain unchanged, causing the caster to include themselves in the blast.
> - **Lightning Bolt:** because Lightning Bolt already has a range of self, its behavior would be entirely unchanged.
> - **Animate Objects:** the conjured objects are creatures, meaning their attacks are not yours, so this spell does not benefit from _Abyssal Shroud_.
> - **Spectral Horde:** the illusions are not creatures, meaning their attacks _are_ yours, so this spell _does_ recharge _Abyssal Shroud_.
> - **Blade of Disaster:** the blade would appear beside you, but because you are making a melee spell attack through it, it would deal bonus damage from your Charisma modifier and would grant you temporary hit points.
>
> You may wish to work with your DM to rename particular spells to reflect the point-blank nature of your spellcasting.  For instance, _Fire Bolt_ might become _Fire Claw_.

#### Unnatural Movement - 6 [New]

Starting at 6th level, your body begins to acclimate to the churning energies within, allowing you to channel them into bursts of speed.  As a bonus action, you can take the Dash action.  Attacks of opportunity against you during this bonus action’s movement have disadvantage.  You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).  You regain all uses of this feature on a short or long rest.

#### Cloak of Chaos - 14 [New]

Starting at 14th level, your body has nearly mastered the power within it, granting immunity to the effects of your own spells unless you wish to be affected.

Additionally, your agility improves to make you all but untouchable when you’re on the move.  When you use your Unnatural Movement feature, you become untargetable by attacks of opportunity until the end of your current turn.

#### Hunger of the Abyss - 18 [New]

At 18th level, you have mastered the power within you, granting you access to a nearly limitless well of vitality.  When you cast a Sorcerer spell and it first damages a creature, you can expend a number of hit dice up to the level of the spell.  For each hit die expended in this way, you regain hit points equal to the size of the die.

### Astral Magic [New]

The magic that suffuses your soul stems from the magic of the Astral Plane itself where thought alters reality.  This power allows you to summon reinforcements for your allies and obstacles for your enemies.  Perhaps you fell through a planar portal to the Astral plane, you grew up next to a wizard’s lab with little concern for the fabric of reality around it, or you were pulled into the dream of a powerful psionic being.

#### Summoning Spells

Drawing on the power within your soul, you can develop the skills necessary to conjure allies from thin air.  The following spells count as Sorcerer spells for you.

##### Summon Spells Table

| Spell Level | Spells                                  |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------- |
|     1st     | _Summon Servant_                        |
|     2nd     | _Summon Beast_                          |
|     3rd     | _Summon Shadowspawn_, _Summon Undead_   |
|     4th     | _Summon Aberration_, _Summon Elemental_ |
|     6th     | _Summon Fiend_                          |

#### Summoned Servant [New]

When you choose this sorcerous origin at 1st level, you learn the spell _Summon Servant_.  It does not count against the number of spells you know.  When you increase in level, you cannot exchange this spell for another.

#### Enhanced Creations [New]

When you create a creature from one of the spells in the Summoning Spells table, select one of the following ways to enhance it:

- Using its bonus action, the summoned creature can move a number of feet equal to 5 times your Charisma modifier (minimum 5 feet).
- The summoned creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your Sorcerer level, rounded down (minimum 1).
- If it does not already possess an attack action, it gains a melee weapon attack using your spell attack modifier to hit.  On a hit, the attack does 1d4 plus your proficiency bonus as piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, with the DM selecting an element appropriate for the form.  If the summoned creature already has an attack, you can choose to use your proficiency bonus in place of its Strength or Dexterity for the damage roll.
- When the creature deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, the damage counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances to nonmagical attacks.

Starting when you reach 6th level, you can select two options at once instead of one.

#### Flash Creations - 6 [New]

Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 2 mana points to create a translucent barrier of magical force at an unoccupied point you can see within 60 feet that lasts until the end of your next turn.

The barrier takes the form of a plane of magical force 5 feet by 5 feet and is one inch thick.  It may be oriented in any way you choose.  The force barrier has an AC of 10 plus your Charisma modifier, a number of hit points equal to your Sorcerer level, and sheds dim light in a 10 foot radius.

It resists motion, but for every 1000 pounds of force applied to it it moves 5 feet per round.  As an action, a creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC to either reorient it or move it 5 feet.

#### Shielded Summons - 14 [New]

Beginning at 14th level, your ability to instantly create barriers has grown to the point that you can use it to defend your allies.  After damage has been rolled and declared for an effect targeting a creature you summoned, but before the damage is applied, you can use your reaction to expend any number of mana points to shield your summoned creature.  For each mana point expended, the damage the summoned creature would receive is reduced by 10.

#### Twin Summons - 18 [New]

Once you reach 18th level, when you cast one of the spells from the Summoning Spells table, in place of applying a metamagic, you can expend additional mana points equal to the level of the spell to summon two creatures from the spell instead of one.  The two creatures can be the same archetype or different archetypes.  The two creatures appear at unoccupied target positions of your choice that you can see within range.

### Geomancy [New]

> _lorem ipsum flavor text_

#### Dynamic Cover [New]

When you select this sorcerous origin, you learn the _Mold Earth_ spell, which does not count against your number of cantrips known.

Additionally, you can cast _Mold Earth_ as a Bonus Action a number of times equal to half your Sorcerer level, rounded down, to a minimum of 1. You regain all uses on a Short Rest.

#### Earthblessed Steps [New]

You are not slowed by difficult terrain caused by nonmagical unworked earth, sand, or stone.

#### Instant Barricade - 6 [New]

At the end of an ally's turn, you can use your reaction and a Sorcery Point to cast _Mold Earth_, targeting a point within range that is within 5 feet of the ally whose turn just finished.

#### Mass Mold Earth - 14 [New]

When you cast the _Mold Earth_ spell on your turn, you can spend a number of Sorcery Points up to your Charisma modifier to target a number of additional locations equal to the number of points spent.

#### Tectonic Shift - 18 [New]

As an action, select a point on the ground within 120 feet that is nonmagical earth or stone. The ground within a 20-foot radius shifts in the drection of your choice, moving up to 60 feet. Creatures, plants, and objects in the path smaller than the effect are safely shunted to the side. If you attempt to move through a permanent structure, the effect ends.

### Shadow Magic

#### Eyes of the Dark [Updated]

Starting at 1st level, you have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you gain the ability to see through magical darkness you create.

### Wild Magic

#### Tides of Chaos [Updated]

Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.  Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time you cast a leveled spell, you gain a level of Instability.  After the spell has been cast and any instantaneous effects have been applied, roll a d10.  If you roll equal to or less than your level of Instability, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table and reset your Instability to 0.  You then regain your use of Tides of Chaos, if applicable.  When you finish a long rest, reset your Instability to 0.

#### Spell Bombardment [Updated]

When you cast a spell that triggers Wild Magic, you can immediately cast a cantrip, no action required.
