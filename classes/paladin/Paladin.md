Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons with which you are proficient, such as Longbows and Longswords.

### Paladin's Smite - 2 [New]

_replaces Divine Smite_

You have mastered smiting your targets with divine energy. Select a number of the below Smite spells equal to your Charisma modifier to always have prepared, not counting against your number of prepared spells. You can change your selection every time you complete a long rest.
