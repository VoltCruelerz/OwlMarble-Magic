## Unleashed Mind [Updated]

### Rampaging Power [Updated]

Starting at 3rd level, you gain a pool of d4 rampage dice with a single die in the pool. Once on each of your turns when you make a damage roll, you can roll all your rampage dice and add the total to the damage roll. At the start of each of your turns in initiative, if you used your rampage dice during your last turn, the number of rampage dice you have in your pool doubles. If you did not, your number of rampage dice in the pool resets to 1.

When you use your rampage dice, you also take an equivalent amount to the damage rolled as force damage, but you can ignore the damage from a number of dice equal to your Intelligence modifier.

> For example, if your modifier is +3 and you are in the 4th stage, your target will take 8d4 damage while you will only take 5d4.

When you reach 5th level in this class, the rampage dice become d6's. When you reach 11th level, they grows to d8's, and at 17th level, they grow to d10's.

| Tier | Stage 1  | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 4 | Stage 5  |
|:----:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| 1    | 1d4=2.5  | 2d4=5   | 4d4=10  | 8d4=20  | 16d4=40  |
| 2    | 1d6=3.5  | 2d6=7   | 4d6=14  | 8d6=28  | 16d6=52  |
| 3    | 1d8=4.5  | 2d8=9   | 4d8=18  | 8d8=36  | 16d8=72  |
| 4    | 1d10=5.5 | 2d10=10 | 4d10=20 | 8d10=40 | 16d10=80 |

### Uncontrollable Mind [Updated]

Starting at 10th level, the strength of your rampaging mind is such that attempts to control it are futile. While at the 3rd stage of a rampage or higher, you are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions, as well as effects that would control your mind.

### Unstoppable Rampage [Updated]

Starting at 14th level, when an attack reduces you to 0 hit points, you can roll a any number of rampage dice from your pool and add your Constitution modifier. Each rampage die from your pool you roll in this way consumes 1 Psi Point. If the total rolled exceeds the excess damage you took, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point.

## Psionic Talents [Updated]

### Tantrum [New]

_Prerequisite: Unleashed Mind Psion_

Your anger boils just beneath the surface. When you roll initiative, you can instantly increase your rampage stage to 2. Additionally, if you take damage while in stage 1 or 2, you advance 1 stage.

### Stable Rifts [New]

_Prerequisite: 11th level Psion_

When you use your _Phase Rift_ power, you can choose to spend a psi point and leave behind a stable portal 5 feet in diameter that lasts until the end of your next turn. During this time, creatures that move to the mouth of the portal are safely deposited at the nearest unoccupied space near the exit.
