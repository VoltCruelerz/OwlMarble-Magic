# Barbarian


## Extra Attack [Updated]

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

When you would gain this feature, if you already have the Extra Attack feature from another class, you can replace this with a Feat.

## Mighty Arm [New]

Starting at 9th level, while you are raging, you only need to hold a two-handed melee weapon in one hand to attack with it.

## Rage Dice [New]

_Optional Feature_

Instead of a flat damage boost, while raging you instead apply an additional die of damage that scales with your level.
