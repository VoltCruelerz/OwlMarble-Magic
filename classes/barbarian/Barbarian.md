## Weapon Mastery [New]

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of Simple or Martial melee weapons of your choice,  such as Greataxes and Handaxes.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change the kinds of melee weapons you chose.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian table.

## Primal Knowledge [New]

Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the list of skills available to Barbarians at 1st level.

In addition, when you make an Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival check while raging, you can choose to channel primal power and make it as a Strength check instead of the normal ability score.

## Extra Attack [Updated]

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

When you would gain this feature, if you already have the Extra Attack feature from another class, you can replace this with a Feat.

## Fast Movement [Updated]

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

When you reach 11th level, this increases to 20 feet, and again to 30 at level 17.

## Feral Instinct [Updated]

Starting at 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on Initiative rolls and Dexterity saving throws.

## Overwhelming Critical [Updated]

Starting at 9th level, your critical hit range increases by 1, and the number of dice you add on a critical hit increases by the same amount.

This bonus increases to 2 at level 13th level, and 3 at 18th level.

## Indomitable Might [Updated]

Starting at 11th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total, and you have advantage on saving throws to resist Exhaustion.

## Perfect Physique [New]

Starting at 15th level, your long and high jump distance is equal to your walking speed, you count as one size larger for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity, and your range with thrown weapons is doubled.

## Primal Champion [Updated]

Starting at 17th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution increase by 4, to a maximum of 24.

## Rage Resurgence [New]

Starting at 18th level, whenever you roll initiative, you regain one expended use of your Rage.
