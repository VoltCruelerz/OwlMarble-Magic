## General Updates

### Wild Shape [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast. You can use this feature twice. You regain both uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the types of beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Forms table (below), with higher levels increasing the options available to you.

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. If you would make a Constitution check or save, use your Wisdom check or save instead.
- When you transform, you gain temporary hit points based on the form and your druid level.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast, as in the case of _Call Lightning_.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. If an item is cursed, the DM decides what becomes of it in your new form.

### Circle of the Moon

#### Circle Forms [Updated]

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms.  Starting at 2nd level, when you make an attack with your wild shaped form, you deal an extra die of damage on the attack (already included in the [Elemental](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#elemental) template).

#### Elemental Wild Shape [Updated]

At 10th level, you can expend both uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an Air, Earth, Fire, or Water elemental, using the [Elemental](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#elemental) template.
