## Druid Features

### Druid Spellcasting [New]

You have learned to cast spells through studying the ystical forces of nature. See the Playerâ€™s Handbook for he rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Druid.

**Prepared Spells**. You have the following spells prepared: _Cure Wounds_, _Druidcraft_, _Produce Flame_, and _Thunderwave_. Alternatively, you can prepare two 0-level spells (also known as cantrips) and two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Primal spell list. Whenever you finish a Long rest, you can meditate and replace any spell you have prepared for this class with another Primal spell of the same level.

At higher levels in this class, you can prepare more spells, as shown on the Druid table. The numbers there determine the number of different spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 4th-level Druid, you can prepare three different 0-level spells, four different 1st level spells, and three different 2nd-level spells.

**Spell Slots**. When you cast a prepared Druid spell, you expend a Spell Slot. The number of Spell Slots you have of 1st-level and higher is the same as the number of different spells you can prepare of each level, as shown on the Druid table. For example, as a 5th-level Druid, you have four 1st-level Spell Slots, three 2nd-level Spell Slots, and two 3rd-level Spell Slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**. Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Druid spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class.

### Primal Channel [New]

Primal magics infuse you. Tapping into that power, you can create various magical effects. you start with one such effect: _Wild Shape_, which is described below. Other Druid features give you additional Primal Channel effect options. Each time you use this ability, you choose which effect to create from among those you know.

You can use Primal Channel twice. You regain one use when you complete a Short Rest, and you regain all uses on a Long Rest. You gain additional uses at certain druid levels, as shown in the Primal Channel column of the Druid table.

If a Primal Channel effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals your Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

### Primal Channel: Wild Shape [Updated]

Starting at 1st level, you gain the _Shapechanger_ creature type, and you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast.

Your druid level determines the types of beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Forms table (below), with higher levels increasing the options available to you.

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. If you would make a Constitution check or save, use your Wisdom check or save instead.
- When you transform, you gain temporary hit points based on the form and your druid level.
- You can speak with your own voice, regardless of your form.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast, as in the case of _Call Lightning_.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Equipment that is not magically enchanted for it doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. If an item is cursed, the DM decides what becomes of it in your new form.
- If you have a condition that your new form is immune to, the condition is suppressed while you are in your new form.

#### Circle Spells [Updated]

Your mystical connection to your biome infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Land's Stride [Updated]

Starting at 6th level, moving through difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

If you make a saving throw to avoid being grappled or restrained by a plant or to escape such a condition, you have advantage on the roll.

#### Nature's Ward [Updated]

Starting at 10th level, when you cast a spell that impedes movement, restrains creatures, or creates a plant that deals damage with thorns, spines, or similar, your allies are immune to these effects.

Additionally, you are immune to poison and disease.

#### Symbiotic Guardian [New]

Starting at 14th level, you can always speak to plants and animals as if by the spells _Speak with Plants_ and _Speak with Animals_, and you can maintain concentration on two Druid spells simultaneously. If you make a concentration check, roll independently for each spell.

### Circle of the Moon

#### Circle Forms [Updated]

The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms.  Starting at 2nd level, when you make an attack with your wild shaped form, you deal an extra die of damage on the attack (already included in the [Elemental](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#elemental) template).

#### Elemental Wild Shape [Updated]

At 10th level, you can expend both uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into an Air, Earth, Fire, or Water elemental, using the [Elemental](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#elemental) template.

#### Thousand Forms

### Circle of Spores

#### Halo of Spores [Updated]

Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at 14th level.

#### Primal Channel: Symbiotic Entity [Updated]

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Primal Channel feature to awaken those spores, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll an extra d6 and add it to the damage.
- You have half cover.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use a Primal Channel again.
