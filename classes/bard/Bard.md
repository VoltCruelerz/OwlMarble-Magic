# Bard

## Bardic Inspiration [Updated]

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. When you see another creature within 60 feet of you fail a d20 test, you can use your reaction to add a Bardic Inspiration die to the roll, potentially turning that failure into a success.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Bardic Inspiration Die

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.

| Bard Level | Die Size |
:-----------:|:---:|
| 1 | d6 |
| 5 | d8 |
| 10 | d10 |
| 15 | d12 |

## Spellcasting [Updated]

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can use in different situations. See Chapter 10 for the general rules for spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level, and a 4th at 10th level.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher [Updated]

You know a number of spells equal to your bard level plus twice your permanent charisma modifier. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. When you increase your bard level, you can replace any number of your bard you know with other bard spells you meet the criteria for.

### Preparing and Casting Spells [New]

When you finish a short or long rest, you can rehearse your magical music. Select a number of spells equal to half your bard level (rounded down) plus your charisma modifier from your known bard spells that you prepare. Until you rehearse a different list of spells, these spells are available for you to cast using your spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- `Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`
- `Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

#### Unfailing Inspiration [Updated]

When you use your bardic inspiration ability and the creature still fails the roll, the die is not expended.
