# Expectations for 5.5e

This is purely my own list of expectations for 5.5, based on what we've seen so far with the UAs.

## UA 1 - Character Origins

### Subraces

Looks like subraces are being mostly done away with. I'm fine with this.

### Feats

Looks like feats will be leveled. I'm fine with this.

### General Rules

#### **D20 Test**

I think the language will persist, but autocrit ability checks will go the way of the dodo.

#### **Heroic Inspiration**

Humans getting it for free is a _lot_, and getting it on a 20 is just win more.

#### **Unarmed Strike Grapple/Shove**

I think the simplicity of this might work, but the AC targeting is... odd.

## UA 2 - Experts

### Classes

#### **Bard**

No comment. See below regarding spellcasting.

#### **Ranger**

As overtuned as this allegedly is, I don't think it's that bad. I expect it to be nerfed back down to uselessness.

#### **Rogue**

This isn't _bad_, but it needs work.

- _Reliable Talent Lite_ at L5
- _Use an Object_ as _Cunning Action_
- _Subtle Strikes_ will change... somehow.

### Spellcasting

I think we'll see more of this pseudo-vancian casting across all classes as a way to curtail mage utility at higher levels.

### Feats

#### **Charger**

The ranged kiter exploit will be fixed.

#### **Power Attacks** (GWM & SS)

I think these are about to get baked into martials, no feat required.

#### **Lightly Armored**

I'm guessing Medium Armor is getting nerfed? Or maybe Mage Armor is? This seems... unwise for mages to access so easily.

#### **Build Feats** (GWM, SS, SS, CBE, DW)

These seem to be one-stop shops to prevent feat taxes on certain base roles.

#### **Epic Boons**

Some of these are good. Some are... not.

**Oof**

- Combat Prowess
- Dimensional Travel
- Peerless Aim

**Meh**

- Boon of Luck
- Irresistible Offense (too little too late, and doesn't break immunities)
- Unfettered

**Good**

- Energy Resistance
- Boon of Fortitude
- Speed
- Undetectability

**Hot Damn**

- Boon of Recovery
- Skill Proficiency

#### **Other**

_Weapon Training_ staying so weak is... odd. See below for weapon predictions.

### General Rules

#### **Unarmed Strike Grapple/Shove**

I think the simplicity of this might work, but the AC targeting is... odd. Maybe they'll shift to targeting passive Ath/Acr or Str/Dex even?

#### **Flat 15 Stealth**

This is odd. I like it, but maybe if it was just the ceiling of all nearby enemies' passive perception as the DC?

That said, I do think the _Hidden_ condition will stay as-is.

#### **Exhaustion**

I think this will stay.

#### **Fly sans Hover**

I could see this going either way.

#### **Heroic Inspiration on 1**

I think this is more likely, but it'll be more rare due to advantage being far more common than disadvantage.

#### **Jump**

I have _no_ clue what happens here. Also, why does Athlete give this to you as a bonus action?

### Other Guesses

#### **Martial Rework**

I think martials are about to get several major changes:

- baked in power attacks
- most weapons will have a maneuver baked into them as an alternate attack mode
- warriors will be able to use these alt mode maneuvers during normal operation
- something with medium armor
