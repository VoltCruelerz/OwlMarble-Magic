The city is torus-shaped, with gravity such that the inner surface is the “ground.”  It is also called the City of Doors due to literal thousands of portals in it leading to other planes of existence.  Because there are no physical paths in or out of the city, it is also known as the Cage, and citizens are called Cagers.</p><p>Sigil is ruled by the demigoddess Zenith Kyburn, known in this era as the Lady of Magic, or simply “Lady.”  The Lady scarcely interacts with her subjects, preferring to keep to herself and her mysterious plans.  In practice, day-to-day life in Sigil is governed by the Council of Six.</p><p>Sigil is predominantly an interplanar trade hub, relying on taxation through its portals.</p><h2>Influence of the Outlands</h2><p>Unlike other places in the multiverse where hostile alignments clash, there is a pacifying effect on the denizens of the Outlands, and therefore Sigil itself.  This allows for businesses run by fiends to be frequented by celestials, for instance.  Furthermore, the Lady forbids cosmic conflicts from interfering within Sigil.</p><h2>Council of Six</h2><p>Seats on the Council are life terms, and when a seat opens, theoretically anyone can run for the seat, but the Lady has attempted to see the city remains balanced.</p><ul><li><strong>Viesa</strong> (LG): an ancient dragon and archmage, she is the granddaughter of Bahamut and ruled Dar Vangath prior to its fall in 0 EoC.</li><li><strong>Niv-Mizzet</strong> (CN): an ancient dragon and archmage</li><li><strong>Isperia</strong> (LN): an ancient sphinx, if not the original sphinx.  She runs the Halls of Concordance, where legal contracts are forged.</li><li><strong>Zegana</strong> (TN): a merfolk archdruid and pacifist</li><li><strong>Lady Illmarrow</strong> (NE): an elven lich queen that was ousted from her empire on the Plane of Earth and came to Sigil.  She claims to only eat the souls of unintelligent creatures these days.</li><li><strong>Councilman Azorious</strong> (??): a recent addition to the Council, Azorious is ostensibly a pacifist who wishes to increase trade with the outside world.</li></ul><h2>Law Enforcement</h2><p>The Dabus, a band of warlocks dedicated to the Lady, fulfill the role of law enforcement within Sigil.  They carry crystalline identification badges, and speak with Her authority.  Dabus agents typically work in pairs, though some work independently.  These agents report to their superiors who in turn report to the Lady, though due to her nature, they avoid involving her unless the threat to Sigil is dire.</p><p>Criminals within the city are polymorphed into sheep and sent to a demiplane crafted by the Lady known as the Pasture where they serve out their terms.</p>"}

While in the Outlands.</li></ul><h2>Epoch of Cities</h2><p>After the arrival of the Traveler and the Magequakes that shattered much of civilization, large expanses of the world were flooded and rendered uninhabitable.  To stave off global starvation, Midnight Magic mass produced its food makers.  This caused the price of food to crash, and led to a mass exodus of farmers to cities in search of other work.</p><p>With no need to manage large swaths of land, eventually, the wilds reclaimed unused farmland.  Meanwhile, cities grew larger and more independent, with former nations ultimately shattering into city states.</p><h3>Technology Level</h3><p>In the 300+ years since campaign 1, technology and magic have improved.  Portals now connect much of the multiverse, with cities on the same plane often connected by sea and air ships.  Recently, Midnight Magic has begun establishing lightning rail routes that allow for high-speed transit between major cities, bypassing tariffs Sigil imposes on portal traffic.</p><h3>Geopolitics</h3><p>With the world so separated, there has been little geopolitical conflict, leading to a record infrequency of wars and military action.</p><p>As more portals through Sigil and lightning rail lines on the Prime Material Plane are opened, the world is finally growing smaller again, increasing risk of conflict.</p><h4>Crust Wars & Warforged</h4><p>In 45 EoC, Drow forces from Menzoberranzan assaulted the fledgling Orzenel Republic.  This led to an evacuation of the city.  Through her connections to the surface world, Bray Efriya led an evacuation of allied drow to the surface world where Tazeka Myvalir-Liranov had prepared an area near Cordacet, which would ultimately become New Orzenel.</p><p>Centuries later, in 318 EoC, Lolth’s forces again assaulted the surface world, aiming to exterminate the heretics in New Orzenel.  Due to fears of using undead (because of the Fall of Trista), Midnight Magic undertook the task of creating comparable golems to defend the city.</p><p>Warforged were the result.  When the war ended in 324, the tens of thousands of warforged were ultimately granted personhood by New Orzenel.  This was echoed in Cordacet, Sigil, Luethia, and Moltobon, but other cities have been more hesitant.  Nonetheless, their precise legal status remains somewhat uncertain.</p><h2>Major City States</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/Aerimor.md\">Aerimor</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/City%20of%20Brass.md\">City of Brass</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/Luethia.md\">Luethia</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/Moltobon.md\">Moltobon</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/Sigil.md\">Sigil</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/Trista.md\">Trista</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/setting/cities/Twin%20Cities.md\">Twin Cities</a></li></ul>"}
