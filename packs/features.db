The target must make a Wisdom saving throw.</p><p>On a failure, if the target can make multiple attacks on its turn through the Extra Attack or Multiattack feature, the number of attacks it can make on its next turn is reduced by 1. If the target does not possess either of those features, it instead has disadvantage on the first attack it makes on its next turn. A creature cannot suffer from this effect more than once at a given time.</p><h2>Distant Strike</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Way of the Sun Soul</em></p><p>When you make a Radiant Sun Bolt attack, you can expend a ki point to increase its range to 120 feet.</p><h2>Goad</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a melee monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to goad the target into attacking you.</p><p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn. This technique ends early if you attack or harm another creature or if a creature other than you harms the target.</p><h2>Lunging Strike</h2><p>When you make an attack with an Unarmed Strike or a melee monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to increase the reach of the attack by 5 feet.</p><h2>Pacify</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike on your turn, you can expend any number of ki points to attempt to put the creature to sleep, and you can choose to have the attack deal no damage. If the creature has fewer hit points than 5 times the number of ki points expended, it falls asleep for 1 hour, until it takes damage, or until a creature uses its action to shake it awake.</p><h2>Plant Delusion</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to create a phantom image or sound in the target creature's mind, as if by the *Minor Illusion* spell. The delusion lasts until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Probing Strike</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend up to 8 ki points. For each point spent, you learn one of the following traits of your choice about the target creature:</p><ul><li>damage immunities</li><li>damage resistances</li><li>damage vulnerabilities</li><li>condition immunities</li><li>alignment</li><li>highest saving throw</li><li>lowest saving throw</li><li>surface thoughts and emotional state</li></ul><h2>Shove</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, if the target is Large or smaller, you can expend 1 or more ki points to move the target. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or move 5 feet in a direction of your choice for each ki point expended.</p><h2>Silencing Strike</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to attempt to silence the target. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to form words or the verbal components of spells until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Sweep the Leg</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, if the target is Large or smaller, you can expend 1 ki point to trip the target. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</p><h2>Tracking Strike</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to leave a mystical trace on the target. For the next hour, you know the direction to the creature and your distance from it.</p><h1>Level 5 Techniques</h1><h2>All Part of the Plan</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Way of the Drunken Master</em></p><p>When you miss with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon, you can expend 2 ki points to reroll the attack.</p><h2>Focused Aim</h2><p>When you miss with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon, you can expend any number of ki points, increasing the attack roll by 2 for each point expended, potentially turning a miss into a hit.</p><h2>Instant Counter</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point. If the target makes a melee weapon attack before the end of your next turn while within your reach, you can use your reaction to make an Unarmed Strike or attack with a monk weapon against it. This reaction attack can be enhanced by a Technique, and is made before the target hits or misses.</p><h2>Sabotage Defenses</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 2 ki points to flood the target creature's body, causing it to be more susceptible to hostile magic. Until the end of your next turn, when the target makes a saving throw against a spell, it must roll a d4 and subtract that from the result.</p><h2>Siphon Vitality</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 2 ki points to siphon some of the target's life force. You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.</p><h2>Stunning Strike</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 2 ki points to attempt to stun the target. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><h1>Level 7 Techniques</h1><h2>Strike the Soul</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point to change the attack's damage type to necrotic, radiant, or psychic.</p><h2>Vanishing Strike</h2><p>You learn to strike with such speed that your enemy momentarily loses track of your position. When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a melee monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 1 ki point. If you then immediately move 15 feet or more, you become hidden from the target until the end of your turn or you hit the target again.</p><h2>Vital Strike</h2><p><em>Prerequisite: Way of the Open Hand</em></p><p>Before you make an Unarmed Strike, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can expend 1 ki point to add +10 to the attack's damage.</p><h1>Level 9 Techniques</h1><h2>Mark for Death</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 3 ki points to render the target more vulnerable to attacks. Until the start of your next turn, whenever the target takes damage from an Unarmed Strike or weapon attack, the attack's damage is increased by 1d4. This effect does not stack.</p><h1>Level 11 Techniques</h1><h2>Blindside</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 4 ki points to strike with blinding speed. The target takes additional damage equal to your initiative roll, and your initiative becomes 0 starting at the beginning of the next round.</p><h1>Level 15 Techniques</h1><h2>Expose the Soul</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend 4 ki points to attempt to eject a creature's soul. It must succeed on Charisma saving throw or be paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>Maintaining the disconnect between a creature's body and soul is mentally taxing and requires your concentration, as if on a spell. You can maintain this disconnect on multiple creatures at once, but if your concentration is broken, it is broken for all applications of this ability.</p><h2>Killing Stroke</h2><p>When you hit with an Unarmed Strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can expend any number of ki points. If the target has fewer hit points than the number of ki points expended multiplied by 10, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or die.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"OMM","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"","type":"Creature"},"range":{"value":0,"long":0,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Monk","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"flags":{"owlmarble-magic":{"exportTime":"Sat Apr 20 2024 13:17:51 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)"}}}
