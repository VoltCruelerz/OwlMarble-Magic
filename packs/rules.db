{"_id":"ncHvejVuuIx3IGeC","name":"Actions in Combat","permission":{"default":2},"folder":"","flags":{"owlmarble-magic":{"exportTime":"Sun Jun 05 2022 18:47:09 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)"}},"content":"<p>Each turn in combat, you have Movement, an Action, and a Bonus Action.  Each round you also have a reaction.</p><h2>Movement</h2><p>You have movement each turn unless otherwise specified (i.e. while you are grappled or incapacitated, you do not have any movement).  If you wish to combine speeds, you use fractional speeds.  For instance, if you have a walk speed of 30 and a Fly speed of 100 and walk for 15 before taking off, you may only fly as much as 50 feet.</p><ul><li>Walk: this is your base, normal speed</li><li>Horizontal Jump: from a standstill, you may jump up to half your Strength</li><li>Horizontal Long Jump: if you moved at least 10 feet toward the edge, you may jump up to your full Strength in feet.</li><li>Vertical Jump: you may jump as much as your (Strength Modifier + 3)/2 feet in the air from a standstill.</li><li>Vertical High Jump: you may jump as much as your Strength Modifier + 3 feet in the air provided that you just moved at least 10 feet.</li><li>Climb: unless a creature has a dedicated Climb speed, each foot climbed costs an extra foot of movement.  Slippery surfaces may impose Athletics checks.</li><li>Swim: provided a creature is not so heavy as to instantly sink (at which point you would walk along the bottom while holding your breath) may be considered to be in Difficult Terrain.  Turbulent water may impose Athletics checks.</li><li>Fly: most creatures do not have a Fly speed, but some do</li><li>Drop Prone: dropping Prone (see Prone condition in the PHB) can be done instantly, without consuming any speed.</li><li>Stand Up: standing up from Prone consumes half your movement.</li><li>Difficult Terrain: while moving through difficult terrain, each foot of movement costs 1 extra.</li><li>Crawl: while prone, you can crawl.  Each foot of movement costs 1 additional foot of movement.</li></ul><h2>Action</h2><p>A creature has one action per turn unless otherwise specified (i.e. Action Surge ability of the Fighter class).</p><ul><li>Attack: you perform an attack action.  It might involve a weapon or your fist, but it’s still an Attack Action. You can also replace attacks with options from this list.</li><li>Bonus Action Conversion: If you can do something as a Bonus Action, you can instead elect to perform that act as an Action.  </li></ul><p>If you attempt Ready an Action and the readied Action is a Bonus Action, it is converted to an Action.</p><ul><li>Cast a Spell: You may cast a spell on your turn.  Most spells have a casting time of 1 Action and so fit nicely into the flow of combat.  However, some do not, and if you were to attempt them would consume several actions.  Spells that involve Attack rolls count as Attack Actions for the purpose of rule lawyering.</li><li>Climb Atop: A suitably larger opponent (DM’s discretion) may be climbed atop, and at the DM’s discretion, ability checks may be involved.  Once it is there, the creature performs a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (Acrobatics).  </li><ul><li>If the smaller creature succeeds, it moves into the target’s space, moves with the larger creature and has advantage on attacks against it.</li><li>Once in place, the larger creature may, as an action, attempt to dislodge the small creature, with an Athletics vs Athletics/Acrobatics check.</li></ul><li>Dash: for this turn, you gain additional movement speed equal to your movement speed.  (Note that while that’s a weird way of wording it, it’s worded that way because of rule lawyering.  Basically, you just get to move twice as far on this round if you use Dash.)  WARNING: If you take the Dash action more than 3 plus your Constitution modifier times in a row, you’ll begin making DC 10 CON saving throws.  Failure results in levels of Exhaustion.</li><ul><li>If you had 30 speed, you’ll be able to move 60 feet instead.</li><li>If you had a fly speed of 40, you’ll be able to fly 80 feet instead.</li><li>If you were prone with a speed of 30 and attempt to get up and dash, your movement will be 45 this round.  (30/2=15 is consumed by standing up, leaving another 15, plus the 30 you get from dashing.)</li><li>If you are going through difficult terrain with a speed of 30, if you dash, you could go your normal speed.</li></ul><li>Diplomacy: You attempt to stop the fighting for one round by making a Charisma (Persuasion) check.  If your party is actively engaged in combat, you do so with Disadvantage.  You must have some means of communication with the opposing force for this to work.  Note that not all enemies may stop fighting at once.</li><li>Disengage: You focus purely on getting away and ducking attacks.  During movement on this turn, you do not provoke Opportunity Attacks.</li><li>Dodge: You focus on dodging.  Until the beginning of next turn, all attacks against you have Disadvantage.  Additionally, if you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, if you can see the compelling source, you have advantage.</li><li>Help: You assist an ally.  You may choose to either assist them to give them Advantage on their next Ability Check or harry an opponent to give your ally Advantage on an Attack, provided that they do so before the start of your next turn.  Familiars that cannot attack cannot use Help to aid attacks.</li><li>Hide: You attempt to stealth to hide from your enemies, such as by ducking behind a tree or rock (you cannot attempt to stealth without magical assistance in the middle of an open plain for obvious reasons).  Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, contested by the enemy Passive Perception.  If a particular enemy is actively looking for you, they will make an Active Perception check.</li><li>Overrun: You attempt to charge through a hostile creature’s space.  This is an Athletics vs Athletics check.  If the creatures are of different sizes, the smaller creature has Disadvantage.  Upon success, the charger is able to move through the target’s space once this turn, but may not end there.  (This is the Athletics version of Tumble.)</li><li>Ready an Action: You may set an Action and a Trigger when you wish to wait for something to happen before you act.  Perhaps you wish to wait for your ally to trap the enemy before you attack, for instance.  At most, twelve consecutive readied actions can fire in one round, and up to 100 readied actions can fire in parallel (this ruling prevents stupidity like the Peasant Railgun).</li><li>Action: You select an Action and perform it.  If the Action is Cast a Spell, the casting time must be 1 Bonus Action and delaying a spell until the Trigger requires Concentration.  If concentration is broken or you do not choose to go forward with your action when the trigger occurs, the Spell Slot (if any) is still expended.</li><li>Trigger: You select what specific occurrence will trigger the Action.  This could be waiting for a Cultist to step through the doorway or for the Wizard to cast Fireball.  Activating your readied Action consumes this turn’s Reaction.  If you perform an Opportunity Attack before your trigger occurs, you cannot perform the Readied Action.</li><li>Search: You attempt to find something.  At the DM’s discretion, this may either be Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation).</li><li>Tumble: Acrobatics vs Acrobatics check to determine pass through of an enemy’s space once this turn.  (This is the Acrobatics version of Overrun.)</li><li>Use an Object: some objects require activation.  In such case, use this.</li></ul><h2>Bonus Action</h2><p>Bonus Actions are swiftly performed acts that some class features use.  Additionally, some spells such as Misty Step can be cast so quickly as to be Bonus Actions.</p><h2>Free Action</h2><p>On your turn, you may perform one simple interaction with the world for free, such as drawing or sheathing one weapon, opening a door, or grabbing a waterskin off a table.  If you wish to interact with a second object, you must use your action.</p><h2>Full Turn Action</h2><p>Full Turn Actions consume both your Action and Bonus Action.  Upon taking a FTA, until the beginning of your next turn, attacks against you have advantage and saving throws you make have disadvantage unless they are called for by the specific Full Turn Action itself.  Your speed drops to zero.</p><ul><li>Sprint: This may only be taken if you are on flat, reasonably smooth and hard terrain such as an empty field or road.  Loose terrain such as a sandy beach would not be valid.  While Sprinting, you move up to 4 times your normal walking speed and may only move in straight lines.  After using this, you must make a DC10 Constitution saving throw with advantage or take one level of exhaustion.  If you are hit by an attack while Sprinting, you fall prone and your speed is reduced to 0 for the rest of your turn.</li><li>Soar: This may only be taken if you are in windless skies or have a tail wind.  Your fly speed increases to four times its normal and you may only move in a straight line.  After using this, you just make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw with advantage or receive a level of Exhaustion.  If you are hit by an attack, you drop ten feet.  If this forces you to ground, you take fall damage and land prone, ending your movement there.</li></ul><p>Ability Feat: By performing an ability check in combat as a FTA, you gain advantage on it.</p><h2>Reaction</h2><p>A given creature has one Reaction per round by default, refreshing at the beginning of their turn.  Some abilities and traits can increase this. The below options cover the most common uses for reactions:</p><ul><li>Opportunity Attack: the most common type of Reaction in D&D, you may perform an Opportunity Attack whenever a creature within your melee range exits your melee range, even if it entered on the same turn.  The Attack is a standard melee attack.</li><li>Triggered Actions: If a creature uses Ready an Action, the Trigger counts as their Reaction.</li></ul>"}
