Consider ladders.  <strong>Kenkus</strong> lack creativity.  Small species (<strong>Goblins</strong>, <strong>Halflings</strong>, <strong>Gnomes</strong>) can also be inconvenient, though they usually have strengths in other areas.</li><li><strong>Attention Hogs</strong>: I strongly discourage these for unskilled players.  <strong>Changelings</strong>, <strong>Kenku</strong>, <strong>Verdan</strong>, and <strong>Eladrin</strong> can either hog the spotlight at the table or become unpleasantly boring.  It’s hard to thread that needle, especially if you’re new to TTRPGs or bad at acting.</li><li><strong>“Evil” Species</strong>: Most “monstrous” (minotaur, orc, goblinoid, etc) species actually just live in evil societies, so NPCs will likely think you’re evil upon first meeting you, but you can show them otherwise in time.  This also includes Dark Elves in most settings.</li><li><strong><em>Evil</em> Species</strong>: Some species actually <em>are</em> evil.  <strong>Lizardfolk</strong> and <strong>Yuan-Ti</strong> lack reciprocity and are universally psychopaths.  <strong>Lizardfolk</strong> will eat you the day you stop being useful and <strong>Yuan-Ti</strong> will simply murder you if it suits them.  It is very hard to make either of these a productive party member in an extended campaign.</li><li><strong>Extraplanar Species</strong>: <strong>Aarakocra</strong>, <strong>Gith</strong>, <strong>Kalashtars</strong>, <strong>Satyrs</strong>, <strong>Eladrin</strong>, <strong>Genasi</strong>, <strong>Shadar-kai</strong>, <strong>Thri-Kreen</strong>, etc.  Because they’re not from around here, they’ll always be seen as Other.  It also means your backstory will probably matter less in the plot.  Naturally, this only applies if the campaign’s setting doesn’t deal with their plane of origin.</li></ul>"}
{"_id":"p6FN9QmDTcv0SdCa","name":"Actions in Combat","permission":{"default":2},"folder":"","flags":{"owlmarble-magic":{"exportTime":"Thu Jun 16 2022 00:27:03 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)"}},"content":"<p>Each turn in combat, you have Movement, an Action, and a Bonus Action.  Each round you also have a reaction.</p><h2>Movement</h2><p>You have movement each turn unless otherwise specified (i.e. while you are grappled or incapacitated, you do not have any movement).  If you wish to combine speeds, you use fractional speeds.  For instance, if you have a walk speed of 30 and a Fly speed of 100 and walk for 15 before taking off, you may only fly as much as 50 feet.</p><ul><li>Walk: this is your base, normal speed</li><li>Horizontal Jump: from a standstill, you may jump up to half your Strength</li><li>Horizontal Long Jump: if you moved at least 10 feet toward the edge, you may jump up to your full Strength in feet.</li><li>Vertical Jump: you may jump as much as your (Strength Modifier + 3)/2 feet in the air from a standstill.</li><li>Vertical High Jump: you may jump as much as your Strength Modifier + 3 feet in the air provided that you just moved at least 10 feet.</li><li>Climb: unless a creature has a dedicated Climb speed, each foot climbed costs an extra foot of movement.  Slippery surfaces may impose Athletics checks.</li><li>Swim: provided a creature is not so heavy as to instantly sink (at which point you would walk along the bottom while holding your breath) may be considered to be in Difficult Terrain.  Turbulent water may impose Athletics checks.</li><li>Fly: most creatures do not have a Fly speed, but some do</li><li>Drop Prone: dropping Prone (see Prone condition in the PHB) can be done instantly, without consuming any speed.</li><li>Stand Up: standing up from Prone consumes half your movement.</li><li>Difficult Terrain: while moving through difficult terrain, each foot of movement costs 1 extra.</li><li>Crawl: while prone, you can crawl.  Each foot of movement costs 1 additional foot of movement.</li></ul><h2>Action</h2><p>A creature has one action per turn unless otherwise specified (i.e. Action Surge ability of the Fighter class).</p><ul><li>Attack: you perform an attack action.  It might involve a weapon or your fist, but it’s still an Attack Action. You can also replace attacks with options from this list.</li><li>Bonus Action Conversion: If you can do something as a Bonus Action, you can instead elect to perform that act as an Action.  </li></ul><p>If you attempt Ready an Action and the readied Action is a Bonus Action, it is converted to an Action.</p><ul><li>Cast a Spell: You may cast a spell on your turn.  Most spells have a casting time of 1 Action and so fit nicely into the flow of combat.  However, some do not, and if you were to attempt them would consume several actions.  Spells that involve Attack rolls count as Attack Actions for the purpose of rule lawyering.</li><li>Climb Atop: A suitably larger opponent (DM’s discretion) may be climbed atop, and at the DM’s discretion, ability checks may be involved.  Once it is there, the creature performs a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target’s Dexterity (Acrobatics).  </li><ul><li>If the smaller creature succeeds, it moves into the target’s space, moves with the larger creature and has advantage on attacks against it.</li><li>Once in place, the larger creature may, as an action, attempt to dislodge the small creature, with an Athletics vs Athletics/Acrobatics check.</li></ul><li>Dash: for this turn, you gain additional movement speed equal to your movement speed.  (Note that while that’s a weird way of wording it, it’s worded that way because of rule lawyering.  Basically, you just get to move twice as far on this round if you use Dash.)  WARNING: If you take the Dash action more than 3 plus your Constitution modifier times in a row, you’ll begin making DC 10 CON saving throws.  Failure results in levels of Exhaustion.</li><ul><li>If you had 30 speed, you’ll be able to move 60 feet instead.</li><li>If you had a fly speed of 40, you’ll be able to fly 80 feet instead.</li><li>If you were prone with a speed of 30 and attempt to get up and dash, your movement will be 45 this round.  (30/2=15 is consumed by standing up, leaving another 15, plus the 30 you get from dashing.)</li><li>If you are going through difficult terrain with a speed of 30, if you dash, you could go your normal speed.</li></ul><li>Diplomacy: You attempt to stop the fighting for one round by making a Charisma (Persuasion) check.  If your party is actively engaged in combat, you do so with Disadvantage.  You must have some means of communication with the opposing force for this to work.  Note that not all enemies may stop fighting at once.</li><li>Disengage: You focus purely on getting away and ducking attacks.  During movement on this turn, you do not provoke Opportunity Attacks.</li><li>Dodge: You focus on dodging.  Until the beginning of next turn, all attacks against you have Disadvantage.  Additionally, if you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, if you can see the compelling source, you have advantage.</li><li>Help: You assist an ally.  You may choose to either assist them to give them Advantage on their next Ability Check or harry an opponent to give your ally Advantage on an Attack, provided that they do so before the start of your next turn.  Familiars that cannot attack cannot use Help to aid attacks.</li><li>Hide: You attempt to stealth to hide from your enemies, such as by ducking behind a tree or rock (you cannot attempt to stealth without magical assistance in the middle of an open plain for obvious reasons).  Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, contested by the enemy Passive Perception.  If a particular enemy is actively looking for you, they will make an Active Perception check.</li><li>Overrun: You attempt to charge through a hostile creature’s space.  This is an Athletics vs Athletics check.  If the creatures are of different sizes, the smaller creature has Disadvantage.  Upon success, the charger is able to move through the target’s space once this turn, but may not end there.  (This is the Athletics version of Tumble.)</li><li>Ready an Action: You may set an Action and a Trigger when you wish to wait for something to happen before you act.  Perhaps you wish to wait for your ally to trap the enemy before you attack, for instance.  At most, twelve consecutive readied actions can fire in one round, and up to 100 readied actions can fire in parallel (this ruling prevents stupidity like the Peasant Railgun).</li><li>Action: You select an Action and perform it.  If the Action is Cast a Spell, the casting time must be 1 Bonus Action and delaying a spell until the Trigger requires Concentration.  If concentration is broken or you do not choose to go forward with your action when the trigger occurs, the Spell Slot (if any) is still expended.</li><li>Trigger: You select what specific occurrence will trigger the Action.  This could be waiting for a Cultist to step through the doorway or for the Wizard to cast Fireball.  Activating your readied Action consumes this turn’s Reaction.  If you perform an Opportunity Attack before your trigger occurs, you cannot perform the Readied Action.</li><li>Search: You attempt to find something.  At the DM’s discretion, this may either be Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation).</li><li>Tumble: Acrobatics vs Acrobatics check to determine pass through of an enemy’s space once this turn.  (This is the Acrobatics version of Overrun.)</li><li>Use an Object: some objects require activation.  In such case, use this.</li></ul><h2>Bonus Action</h2><p>Bonus Actions are swiftly performed acts that some class features use.  Additionally, some spells such as Misty Step can be cast so quickly as to be Bonus Actions.</p><h2>Free Action</h2><p>On your turn, you may perform one simple interaction with the world for free, such as drawing or sheathing one weapon, opening a door, or grabbing a waterskin off a table.  If you wish to interact with a second object, you must use your action.</p><h2>Full Turn Action</h2><p>Full Turn Actions consume both your Action and Bonus Action.  Upon taking a FTA, until the beginning of your next turn, attacks against you have advantage and saving throws you make have disadvantage unless they are called for by the specific Full Turn Action itself.  Your speed drops to zero.</p><ul><li>Sprint: This may only be taken if you are on flat, reasonably smooth and hard terrain such as an empty field or road.  Loose terrain such as a sandy beach would not be valid.  While Sprinting, you move up to 4 times your normal walking speed and may only move in straight lines.  After using this, you must make a DC10 Constitution saving throw with advantage or take one level of exhaustion.  If you are hit by an attack while Sprinting, you fall prone and your speed is reduced to 0 for the rest of your turn.</li><li>Soar: This may only be taken if you are in windless skies or have a tail wind.  Your fly speed increases to four times its normal and you may only move in a straight line.  After using this, you just make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw with advantage or receive a level of Exhaustion.  If you are hit by an attack, you drop ten feet.  If this forces you to ground, you take fall damage and land prone, ending your movement there.</li></ul><p>Ability Feat: By performing an ability check in combat as a FTA, you gain advantage on it.</p><h2>Reaction</h2><p>A given creature has one Reaction per round by default, refreshing at the beginning of their turn.  Some abilities and traits can increase this. The below options cover the most common uses for reactions:</p><ul><li>Opportunity Attack: the most common type of Reaction in D&D, you may perform an Opportunity Attack whenever a creature within your melee range exits your melee range, even if it entered on the same turn.  The Attack is a standard melee attack.</li><li>Triggered Actions: If a creature uses Ready an Action, the Trigger counts as their Reaction.</li></ul>"}

This confers the below benefits.  You are considered elevated compared to another creature if the anchor point of your character is at least 10 feet higher than the anchor point of the other creature, where anchor points are the stabilizing points holding a creature in place.  Most often, this is the feet, but could be the center of mass when flying.  As an example, a Huge-sized giant would not have the High Ground against a goblin standing on the same horizontal plane despite its head and shoulders being more than 10 feet above the Goblin.</p><ul><li>For every 10 feet you are elevated above your opponent for the first 30 feet, your critical hit range increases by 1.</li><li>You gain advantage on perception checks to survey open areas below you.</li><li>If a creature you have the high ground on drops prone, your attacks do not take disadvantage against them.</li></ul>"}
{"_id":"VnmDvIJ617VlRUDL","name":"Critical Hits","permission":{"default":2},"folder":"","flags":{"owlmarble-magic":{"exportTime":"Thu Jun 16 2022 00:27:03 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)"}},"content":"<h2>Balance and Limitations</h2><p>Critical Hits are a mechanism by which combat is made more enjoyable and are a major component of the underlying balancing of D&D 5th Edition due to the mechanic acting as a great equalizer.  Even a lucky Goblin could score a hit on an ancient Dragon.  That said, by the rules as written (RAW), critical hits only apply to attack rolls in combat.  They do not apply to skill checks.</p><p>Now, many DMs will allow crits on skill checks…  most of the time.  If you want to persuade a noble and roll a crit, most DMs will say that they go along with it.  It’s fun, it’s rewarding, and the game works out the better for it.  But there are certain things that have wandered into the realm of the absurd, and for these things, a 20 is no different than a 1.  Sometimes, a player will attempt to preempt this by rolling a skill check before the DM calls for it.  Such rolls are invalid.</p><p>For a few extreme examples, consider the following.</p><ul><li>Persuade a Lich to give up immortality: a Lich has existed for so long because they are so powerful and determined.  They’re not going to just give up their prized possession.</li><li>Swim up a Waterfall: You are not salmon, and even they have to leap up the waterfalls.</li><li>Shoot the Moon: I don’t care how high your Strength or Dexterity is.  You can’t shoot the moon with an arrow.</li></ul><p>A player that says “I want to try to body slam the Tarrasque.  *rolls without being instructed to by DM*  Crit!” is not behaving appropriately, and the DM will not honor that imaginary crit.</p><h2>Effect</h2><p>When a Natural 20 is rolled on a d20 on an Attack Roll, a creature is said to have gotten a Critical Hit.  Instead of doubling the damage dice as is the stock rule, at my table, the damage die is rolled as normal and it has a maximized die of the same size added to the total.  For instance, if you get a crit on a Firebolt spell (1d10) and roll a 1 on the damage, that would be underwhelming by the stock rules as you would only deal 2 points of damage.  Under my house rules, you would instead deal 11 points of damage (d10 + 10).  This ensures crits are always worth it and keeps players from feeling underwhelmed.</p><p>Additionally, this helps account for the minor balance difference between spell attacks and save-for-half spells.</p>"}

Turns happen sequentially as a gameplay construct, but theoretically occur simultaneously.  Each round of combat progresses through three phases in order: Initiative, Planning, and Resolution.</p><h3>Initiative Phase</h3><p>At the start of each round, every creature in combat rolls initiative to symbolize their responsiveness in combat for that round.</p><p><strong>Initiative Roll</strong>: `1d20 + dexterity modifier + intelligence modifier`</p><p>Sort the list of creatures according to the initiative order.  In the event of a tie, any tied PCs go first in whatever order they wish and then any tied NPCs go in whatever order they wish.</p><p>If there are multiple NPCs with the same stat block, roll initiative for them once as a group and have them resolve their turns in whatever order of their choice among themselves.</p><h3>Planning Phase</h3><p>Beginning with the creature with the lowest initiative score and ascending in the order, each creature declares what activities they will perform on their turn.  This allows creatures that are more responsive and quick-witted to act in such a way as to thwart the actions of their opponents.</p><h3>Resolution Phase</h3><p>The creature with the highest initiative roll resolves their planned activities.  You then proceed down the initiative order from highest to lowest.  On each creature’s turn, the creature may execute their planned activities, some or all of which may be replaced or supplemented with Improvised Activities or cancelled entirely.</p><h2>Combat Activities</h2><p>Combat activities include all things a creature can do on its turn such as actions, bonus actions, free actions, no-action features, and movement.</p><h3>Planned Activities</h3><p>If a combat activity has a target (such as an attack target or movement destination), you need not specify the target during the planning phase.</p><p>If a creature’s planned activity is the casting of a spell through means other than Innate Spellcasting feature and the spell has a casting time of 1 action or longer, if the caster takes damage, the caster must make a Concentration check or lose the spell.  If the caster fails the concentration check and the spell has a casting time of longer than 1 action, the spell slot powering the spell is consumed as the magic falls apart.</p><h3>Improvised Activities</h3><p>If a creature’s original plan becomes impossible or undesirable, during the creature’s resolution phase turn, the creature can think quickly on its feet and choose to perform improvised activities instead.  If the cancelled planned activity would have consumed resources, those resources are not consumed unless the activation time of the planned activity was longer than 1 action.</p><p>Unfortunately, because the improvised activity was unplanned, the creature cannot fulfill it to the best of their ability.  For an improvised activity, any ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws the creature must make to fulfill it are made with disadvantage.  Similarly, any saving throws it imposes on other creatures to resist the activity’s effects are made with advantage.</p><h2>Relevant Feats</h2><h3>Quick-Witted [New]</h3><p>Your mind and reflexes sharpen, allowing you to swiftly think through myriad possibilities in combat.  When you improvise activities on your turn, disadvantage due to lack of planning becomes a -1 modifier and creatures making saving throws against your improvised activities only have a +1 modifier.</p><h2>Commentary</h2><ul><li>Due to rerolling initiative, this essentially mandates use of a VTT so the game is not slowed to a crawl.</li><li>This system is more tactical than the default initiative rules.  Not all tables will prefer that.</li><li>Due to the possibility of spell losses and the penalty of improvisation, it will be more valuable to casters to have fallback options prepared such as Misty Step, Healing Word, or Magic Missile that will always succeed.</li><li>Effects that last until the beginning of a creature’s next turn will sometimes have odd effects if the turn order drastically changes.</li><li>Creatures that are slower will likely want to go last so as to preserve their plans.  This also means that martials characters of any sort will likely want at least some dexterity or intelligence, or at minimum the Alert feat.</li></ul>"}

This system relies upon enchanting items to have the behavior of existing spells. If you would like to have a custom spell, speak with your DM.  Additionally, some combinations may prove overpowered in your campaign, so always speak with your DM before crafting.</p><ul><li><strong>Quality</strong>: any substrate material can be any quality.  Higher quality eases crafting.</li><li><strong>Material</strong>: There are many substrates that can be enchanted and each has unique properties.</li><li><strong>Enchantment Source</strong>: this determines how frequently you can use an enchanted item, how long it takes to recharge, and how often it must be maintained.  When a source is created, it gains the spell exactly as the creator can cast it, excluding temporary buffs.  Permanent features like Spell Sniper do apply.</li><ul><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: saturated items are bombarded by magic until the entire item assumes the effects.  Saturated items can be used indefinitely, never need to recharge, and are always Attuned.  Saturation supports Parasitic Cantrips.</li><li><strong>Reactor</strong>: reactor-based items have a number of charges stored in Nodes that regenerate over time.  Reactors can be Isolated or Attuned.  Attuned reactors support Parasitic Cantrips.</li><li><strong>Runes</strong>: Runes are single-use magical storage mechanisms.  To restore expended runes, you must re-enchant the item.  Runes are always Isolated.</li><ul><li><strong>Known</strong>: Runes can be constructed to require knowledge of the runes as in Spell Scrolls.</li><li><strong>Unstable</strong>: Unstable runes deal the spell's level in force damage to the substrate upon activation as in Potions or Spell Scrolls.</li></ul></ul><li><strong>Special Effects</strong>: There are several special effects that can add to a basic enchantment.</li><ul><li><strong>Parasitic Cantrips</strong>: Attuned Reactors and Saturated items exude magic passively which can be harnessed by cantrip enchantments which consume minimal magical power in comparison.  Parasitic Cantrips can be used at will without fear of affecting the main enchantment.  Parasitic Cantrips are limited by the Impulse of the exuded magic and the spell level.  See the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a> for details.</li><li><strong>On-Hit</strong>: Once a melee item has been enchanted with Magic Weapon, it can have on-hit Cantrips.  The total cantrip grades triggered on hit must be no more than the +X bonus of Magic Weapon.  Only Touch and Self ranged Cantrips may be used.  At time of enchantment, you can specify if a Touch cantrip targets the user, the item, or the target.  On-Hit effects only trigger on attacks taken as part of the Attack action (or Multiattack for NPCs).</li><li><strong>On-Shot</strong>: Once a ranged weapon has been enchanted with Magic Weapon, it can trigger ranged cantrips to target the same thing. Make separate attack rolls as relevant.  Only ranged cantrips can be triggered by On-Shot.  The maximum number of cantrip grades that can be triggered is equal to the bonus from Magic Weapon.</li><li><strong>On-Struck</strong>: Armor enchanted with Magic Armor can be made to trigger cantrips with any sort of range upon the wearer taking damage.  At time of enchantment, you must specify if the cantrip targets the user, attacker, or armor itself.  You may trigger no more cantrip grades than the bonus granted by Magic Armor.</li><li><strong>Quick Activation</strong>: By default, activating a magic item requires a full action.  For spells with a casting time of a bonus action or a reaction, if you enchantment an item to have the Parasitic Cantrip Zenith's Servant, you can specify an activation word that you can say as a bonus action or reaction to trigger the enchantment.</li></ul><li><strong>Special Cases</strong></li><ul><li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: Ammunition is enchanted in bulk for small items (arrows, darts, bolts) and individually for large items (spears, daggers, etc).  See the costs section below for details.</li><li><strong>Healing</strong>: enchantments that restore lost hit points have healing effects as if down-cast by one level and cannot be saturated.</li><li><strong>Multiple Sources</strong>: An item has no Spell Flux limit, but an item cannot occupy more than one attunement slot at a time.  This has some implications.</li><ul><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: Cannot coexist with attuned reactors.</li><li><strong>Runes</strong>: Runes can be safely applied to any item.</li><li><strong>Attuned Reactors</strong>: More than one of these can exist on an item, but a user cannot have more than one active at a time and must fully unattune and attune when switching between them.</li><li><strong>Isolated Reactors</strong>: There is no limit to the number of Isolated Reactors on an item.</li><li><strong>Parasitic Cantrips</strong>: the parasitic cantrips remain bound to the primary source and cannot feed off other sources on an item.</li></ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: to instill an item with intelligence or autonomy requires particular enchantments, such as Zenith's Servant, Unseen Servant, Awaken, and Imprisonment.</li></ul></ul><h3>Spell Flux</h3><p><strong>Spell Flux</strong> is a new limitation, similar to Attunement or Encumbrance Capacity that affects magical items.  A player’s maximum Spell Flux is equal to 10x their level.  A player cannot have more spell flux worth of items on them than their maximum.  Every round this has been exceeded, they take 1 point of force damage.</p><p>The following dictates the magical flux given off by various items.  Cantrips count as Grade/2:</p><ul><li><strong>Saturated</strong>: 3 times spell level</li><li><strong>Reactor Nodes</strong>: reactor nodes times spell level</li><li><strong>Attuned Reactor</strong>: mana per day divided by 2</li><li><strong>Isolated Reactor</strong>: mana per day divided by 4</li><li><strong>Runes</strong>: rune count times spell level</li></ul><p>Items in a bag of holding do not give off spell flux.</p><h3>Materials</h3><ul><li><strong>Steel</strong>: standard stats</li><li><strong>Silvered Steel</strong>: bonus damage to a few creatures</li><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: +100 for equipment, +10 for ammunition</li></ul><li><strong>Bronze</strong>: immune to rusting effects</li><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>: x1.3</li></ul><li><strong>Quicksilver</strong>: A highly flexible metal that vibrates surprisingly little when struck.</li><ul><li><strong>Armor</strong>: No stealth penalty due to sound</li><li><strong>Weapons</strong>: counts as silver</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: x1.5</li></ul><li><strong>Faeleaf</strong>: dense, flexible plant matter grown by the Seely Court</li><ul><li><strong>Armor</strong>: Heavy armor made from this material allows a wearer to add their Dexterity modifier to their AC (max 2)</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: x2.</li></ul><li><strong>Mithral</strong>: weighs a third as much as steel</li><ul><li><strong>Armor</strong>: no strength requirement, can be treated as one class down for proficiencies</li><li><strong>Weapons</strong>: heavy trait is lost and normal weapons become light.  If a weapon could increase its damage die by using two hands, that is now its standard die.  Using two hands has no benefit.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: x2</li><li>Only comes as Masterwork (x6 to cost in practice)</li></ul><li><strong>Adamantine</strong>: metal that cannot be shattered</li><ul><li><strong>Armor</strong>: Crit range of incoming attacks reduced by 1 and all incoming damage is reduced by 1.</li><li><strong>Shields</strong>: +1 AC</li><li><strong>Weapons</strong>: Crit Range increased by 1 and use larger damage die.</li><li><strong>Foci</strong>: +1 to AC that does not stack with shields.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: x3</li><li>Only comes as Masterwork. (x9 to cost in practice)</li></ul><li><strong>Orichalcum</strong>: priceless metal of the gods</li><ul><li><strong>Armor</strong>: resists all non-magical physical damage, gives a reductive damage threshold equal to twice the item’s AC bonus, and immunity to spells below fourth level</li><li><strong>Shields</strong>: +2 AC</li><li><strong>Weapons</strong>: Ignores resistances and counts as magical damage</li><li><strong>Foci</strong>: up-casts spells by one level</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: N/A.  Orichalcum is so rare and powerful that it cannot be bought by any discrete gold value and must instead be traded for or killed over.</li></ul></ul><p>Players can purchase or craft items with enchantments on them, but the number of times you can use an object, the player’s prior experience crafting that item, the player’s access to the appropriate tools, the player’s spellcasting level, and the spell level of the enchantment all affect how long it takes and how much it costs.</p><h3>Can You Craft It?</h3><p>A player may construct their own magical item, should they meet the following conditions:</p><p>1. They have a spell slot for the spell level of the effect</p><p>2. The player has the substrate item (i.e. a sword for a +1 sword)</p><p>3. The player has the gold to create the item with</p><p>4. The player has access to the relevant tool set (i.e. Smith’s Tools if they wish to make a +1 sword).  They need not be proficient in it (though it will certainly help).</p><p>5. At least one of the following:</p><p>  A. The player has a complete Formula for the item.</p><p>  B. The player knows and has the relevant spell prepared.</p><p>  C. The player has a partial formula and an assistant with the spell known and prepared.</p><h3>Item Cost</h3><p>The gold value of the item is altered by the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Base Cost</strong>: please see the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a> for the base enchantment cost.</li><ul><li><strong>Spell Level</strong>: the higher the level of the spell (or grade of the cantrip), the greater the cost.</li><li><strong>Healing</strong>: enchantments that heal will usually need to be up-cast.</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong>: as this is unlimited, it is expensive.</li><ul><li><strong>Parasitic Cantrips</strong>: The cost of the corresponding Parasitic Cantrips is the same as the cantrip’s default Saturation Cost if it existed alone.</li></ul><li><strong>Runes</strong>: Runes are cheaper when made in bulk.</li><ul><li><strong>Unstable Runes</strong>: Rune cost = rune cost / 2</li><li><strong>Rune Knowledge</strong>: Rune cost = rune cost / 2</li></ul><li><strong>Reactors</strong>: Reactors absorb ambient magic and store it in Nodes.  The greater a Reactor’s rate of generation, the higher the cost.  An item may have more than one Reactor, but only one (and by extension the spell it stores inside it) can be Attuned at a time.</li><ul><li><strong>Nodes</strong>: a multi-use store of magic that is recharged by a Reactor.  The more Nodes that are attached to a Reactor, the more expensive it becomes.</li><li><strong>Parasitic Cantrips</strong>: The cost of a Parasitic Cantrips is the cantrip's Saturation Cost if it were alone.</li></ul></ul><li><strong>Formula</strong>: possession of a Formula for the item significantly impacts the item creation.  When calculating the rarity of an item, use its Commission Cost (partial formula).</li><ul><li><strong>Complete Formula</strong>: cost = <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a> / 2</li><ul><li>The price of an item with a complete formula is its Mass Production Cost</li></ul><li><strong>Partial Formula</strong>: cost = <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a></li><ul><li>The price of an item with a partial formula is its Commission Cost</li></ul><li><strong>No Formula</strong>: cost = <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a> * 2</li><ul><li>The price of an item without a formula is its Prototype Cost</li></ul></ul><li><strong>Isolation</strong>:</li><ul><li><strong>Isolated Reactor</strong>: Total Renewable Cost = Total Renewable Cost * 5</li><li><strong>Isolated Cantrip Saturation</strong>: Total Cost = Total Cost * 5</li></ul><li><strong>Ammunition</strong>: Ammunition is enchanted in bundles of 10 for arrows/bolts/darts/needles.  Ballista missiles, javelins, and other large projectiles are done individually.  A bundle of arrows has the same enchantment cost as a single normal enchanted item, but the effect may be reduced arithmetically when done in smaller bundles. Ammunition cannot be enchanted with ranged spell attacks.</li><ul><li><strong>Runes</strong>: may be used with any class of projectile</li><li><strong>Potion</strong> (single stable rune without knowledge with a liquid substrate): not directly possible for ammunition, but potions may be spread among however many projectiles as a user wishes, but the potion only remains viable for one hour and each projectile to which the potion is applied takes a portion of the effect.  Applying a Fireball (8d6) potion to 8 arrows would cause each to do only 1d6 damage.</li><li><strong>Reactor</strong>: the if a bundle of projectiles, they come with a case containing the Reactor and each projectile has one Node in it.</li></ul><li><strong>Multiple Sources</strong>: to have multiple reactors or mix reactors with saturation, you must isolate some of the reactors, which adds to the cost.</li><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: degrees of autonomy impact cost.  The higher-autonomy effects have their costs stack with their prerequisites.</li><ul><li><strong>Command Word</strong>: to make a source triggered by a Command Word, it just have to parasitic cantrip Zenith's Servant.</li><li><strong>Minor Autonomy</strong>: to make an item able to follow basic instructions, it must be enchanted with Unseen Servant.</li><li><strong>Sentience</strong>: enchant the object with Unseen Servant and then cast Awaken on it. For this to take hold, the substrate must be Masterwork. Sentient items may be given a simple command at time of Awakening such as “Destroy Evil” or “Protect Elves.” The order becomes the item’s idea of axiomatic good.</li><li><strong>Sapience</strong>: A sapient item is fully conscious and aware and can be conversed with just as any person could.  See the sapient weapon race in the house rules document for more information.  Creating a Sapient item requires enchanting the item with 9th level Soul Safe.</li></ul><li><strong>Spell Has Consumable Material Component</strong>: if the spell requires a consumable component every time it is cast, special rules apply.</li><ul><li><strong>Runes</strong>: for each rune added to an object, the consumable component must be supplied.</li><li><strong>Reactors</strong>: Enchantment reactors cannot contain consumable material components.</li><li><strong>Saturated</strong>: Saturated items do not include consumable components.</li></ul><li><strong>Spell Has Valuable Reusable Component</strong>: if the spell has a non-consumed component with an assigned gold cost, the component must be physically integrated into the final construction or else must be supplied by the user.</li></ul><h3>Crafting Speed</h3><p>How quickly an item is made depends on many things which stack with each other.  The player expends gold each 8-hour shift as they work toward the total item price.  “Exhaustive” means they work a 12-hour shift and receive a level of exhaustion at the end. Exhaustive shifts increase production by 50% after all other modifiers.</p><h4>Default Speed</h4><ul><li><strong>Player Character</strong></li><ul><li><strong>Baseline Speed</strong>: `100gp / day`</li><li><strong>Exhaustive Speed</strong>: `150gp / day`</li></ul><li><strong>Master Magical Artisan (NPC)</strong></li><ul><li><strong>Baseline Speed</strong>: `200gp / day`</li><ul><li><strong>Salary</strong>: `250gp / day`</li></ul><li><strong>Exhaustive Speed</strong>: `300gp / day`</li><ul><li><strong>Salary</strong>: `400 gp / day`</li></ul></ul><li><strong>Apprentice (NPC)</strong></li><ul><li><strong>Baseline Speed</strong>: `50gp / day`</li><ul><li><strong>Salary</strong>: `40 + 2d10gp`</li></ul><li><strong>Exhaustive Speed</strong>: `100gp / day`</li><ul><li><strong>Salary</strong>: `100gp + 2d10`</li></ul></ul></ul><h4>Modifiers</h4><ul><li><strong>In Dedicated Environment</strong>: `+50gp/day` (i.e. Alchemist’s lab, if making potions).  Stacks additively with Proficiency in Tools.</li><li><strong>Proficiency Tier</strong>: `+50gp/day` per level (Proficient -> Expertise -> Mastery -> Supremacy)</li></ul><h4>Collaboration</h4><p>If multiple players work together on an item, they must each be able to make it individually or there will be no change in crafting time.  The total speed is their individual speeds added together. To work successfully together on any given day, the lead crafter must succeed on a Charisma check with a DC equal to the spell level.</p><ul><li><strong>Natural 20</strong>: roll represents a synergistic epiphany and work speed for the day is doubled.</li><li><strong>Normal Success</strong>: normal work speed</li><li><strong>Normal Failure</strong>: work speed is halved</li><li><strong>Natural 1</strong>: due to personality conflicts, only the lead is able to make progress today. All others head home for the day.</li></ul><h3>Difficulty Class</h3><p>How hard it is to craft an item scales with many things.  This is the DC that the player checks against when they have completed their attempt at the item to see if they were successful or not.</p><ul><li><strong>Rarity</strong></li><ul><li>Divine: >1Mgp</li><ul><li>DC = 30</li></ul><li>Legendary: >200kgp</li><ul><li>DC = 25</li></ul><li>Very Rare: >50kgp</li><ul><li>DC = 30</li></ul><li>Rare: >5kgp</li><ul><li>DC = 15</li></ul><li>Uncommon: >500gp</li><ul><li>DC = 10</li></ul><li>Common: >0gp</li><ul><li>DC = 5</li></ul></ul><li><strong>Formula</strong></li><ul><li>Complete Formula: DC = DC - 5</li><li>Partial Formula: DC = DC</li><li>No Formula: DC = DC + 5</li></ul><li><strong>Substrate Quality</strong> (does not apply to Potions or Spell Scrolls)</li><ul><li>Ceremonial: DC = DC + 5</li><li>Masterwork: DC = DC</li><li>Fine: DC = DC + 5</li><li>Standard: DC = DC + 10</li><li>Mediocre: DC = DC + 15</li><li>Crude: DC = DC + 20</li></ul></ul><h3>Crafting Check</h3><p>The final check to create an item is a rather simple ability check:</p><p>`Check = d20 + relevant ability modifier + tool proficiency`</p><ul><li><strong>Relevant Ability Modifier</strong>: see Details section below</li><li><strong>Tool Proficiency</strong>: see Details section below</li></ul><h3>Item Deconstruction</h3><p>A player may deconstruct the magical echoes of an existing, Identified, Kyburnian magical item by expending 50gp per day for a number of days equal to the total spell levels of the item plus 2 hours for each cantrip to retrieve a complete formula for it on a successful Arcana check.  The DC is 5 + twice the total spell levels + the number of cantrips the item is enchanted with.  Failing the DC by less than 5 results in a partial formula.  Failing by 5 or more destroys the item and no formula is gained.  If the item had multiple effects, they receive formulas for all effects upon completion.  Deconstructing an item is not possible until after the item’s effects have been Dispelled.</p><h2>Details</h2><h3>Hired Artisans</h3><p>If a particular magical item is not in stock in a major city, a player may contract a Master Magical Artisan (MMA).  The hired artisan will work toward the price of the item at 200gp per day.  If a player wishes to receive an item faster, they can break apart the job into sub-contracts if there are a large enough number of sufficiently-skilled magical artisans in the city.  For each MMA after the first, the player must also pay an administrative fee of 10% of the item’s cost as the MMAs must work together to ensure that their work meets up properly.  As an example a 1000gp potion could be created by a single MMA in 5 days for 1000gp.  2 MMAs could craft it in 3 days (round up) for 1100gp.  5 MMAs could create it by the end of the day, though it would cost the player 1500gp.  Note that a player may have to make a Persuasion check if they wish to make rival MMAs work together on the same project.</p><p>At the GM’s discretion, it is possible that an MMA may have apprentices allowing them to work faster without charging more money.</p><p>MMAs will also impose a difficulty fee, which is the DC (for them) divided by 10.  That percentage is then added to the item’s cost.  They will then charge again on top of that for profit margins.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Nezznar, with whom the Cursed Spear Campaign’s party had a deal to get 20% of the profits of the Forge of Spells.</p><p>To craft an item with a DC 10 (for him), he would increase the total price of the item by 100%</p><p>He (personally) uses a profit margin of 40%, so when the players who had a deal with him make a purchase, it’s only 32%.</p><p>Thus, the total cost of the players buying something from Nezznar, is 232% of the actual enchantment cost</p><h3>Player Crafting</h3><p>The actual cost to manually manufacture a magic item is usually going to be different than the Market Value as instead of using the default CL of 5, you will enter the creating player’s actual CL.  At lower levels, this is not likely to be economical and will more serve the purpose of making player-desired items and giving the players a stock of Formulas that could be used later.</p><p>A player works toward the completion of an item at a rate of 100gp per day in an 8-hour shift or 150gp in a 12-hour shift during which they must expend spell slots for any enhancements made.  Upon completion of a 12-hour shift, a player takes a level of Exhaustion.  For instance, to create Boots of Flying, every day during their construction, the player would have to expend a 3rd-level Spell Slot (as Fly is a 3rd-level spell).  Productivity increases by 50gp per day if the player is proficient with the relevant tools for creating the object (ie smithing proficiency makes creating a +1 sword go faster).  Productivity also increases by 50gp per day if it the player is creating the item in an area designed for the task (ie an alchemist’s workshop would speed up potion making).  It is assumed that MMAs have the relevant tool proficiencies and the right facilities which is why they have a production rate of 200 gp.</p><p>If, for some reason, a player wishes to pause construction on one magical item to go adventuring or work on something else, they may do so.  No detriment will be imposed for this per se, but if you leave your 99% complete Wand of DOOM lying around where anyone could walk off with it, it’s probably not going to be there when you get back.  Provided the incomplete item is stored safely, there’s no reason for the player to doubt it will be fine when they return.  Obviously, a creative DM could make a whole quest or campaign about retrieving a stolen nearly-complete magical item if he or she believes it would be more fun for the party.</p><p>Upon completion of the construction of the item, the player will make a roll with a DC based upon the rarity of the item.  If the player passes, the item is successfully created.  Regardless of the success or failure of the roll, the gold spent to attempt to create the item is still consumed.  If the DC is missed by a small interval, at the DM’s discretion, the item may be considered still in-progress or may be complete but may have an opposite or lesser effect.  For example, an attempt to make a +2 Sword that fails its DC by 1 might end up being a +1 Sword instead.  A Ring of Feather Fall that fails by 2 might instead make things fall faster.  While that would make the item useless for its intended purpose, a creative party might be able to find alternative uses for it.  If the player fails significantly, perhaps the effect of the spell is instant and reversed, so a player attempting to craft a Potion of Invisibility is instead affected in such a way that the universe becomes invisible to the user and they simply see a white abyss in all directions.</p><h4>Success/Failure Roll</h4><p>The DC of an item creation roll is dependent on its rarity, which is determined by its gold value.  Ties result in successful item creation.  Natural 20s automatically result in a successful creation.  Critical Failures will completely destroy the physical item and do a DM-determined amount of non-lethal damage to the player.  If the DM so desires, the player could also be poisoned, cursed, or have some other status placed upon them.  It is this guide’s recommendation that the scale of the negative status scale with the rarity of the attempted item and that the effect be relevant to the attempted magical effect.  For instance, a failed Belt of Unlimited Misty Step might cause the player to uncontrollably teleport around the room for the next couple days while a failed Belt of Unlimited Gates might cause the player to accidentally teleport into a volcano!  A failed Wand of Meteor Swarms might accidentally obliterate a nearby town, incurring the wrath of the locals.  A failed Ring of Feather Fall might increase fall damage for a time.  You get the idea.</p><h4>Roll Calculations</h4><p>The tool used for enchantment depends on the substrate material.  Each tool has a corresponding ability modifier that is added to it.  For instance, a player proficient in Smith’s Tools, a +2 Proficiency Bonus, and +3 Strength would add +5 to their rolls to create magical swords (presuming they are made of metal).</p><h5>Substrate Material: Tool, Ability</h5><ul><li><strong>Fluid</strong>: Alchemy, Intelligence</li><li><strong>Wood</strong></li><ul><li><strong>Structural/Functional</strong>: Carpentry, Strength</li><li><strong>Artisanal</strong>: Woodcarving, Charisma</li></ul><li><strong>Leather</strong>: Leather-working, Wisdom</li><li><strong>Metal</strong>: Smithing, Strength</li><li><strong>Stone</strong>: Mason, Wisdom</li><li><strong>Crystal</strong>: Jeweler, Dexterity</li><li><strong>Glass</strong>: Glassblower, Constitution</li><li><strong>Cloth</strong>: Weaver, Wisdom</li><li><strong>Food</strong>: Cook, Charisma</li><li><strong>Clay</strong>: Potter, Dexterity</li><li><strong>Paper</strong>: Calligraphy, Dexterity</li><li><strong>Clockwork</strong>: Tinker, Intelligence</li></ul><h4>Formulas</h4><p>A Formula is a blueprint for the creation of a magical item.  Depending on the completeness, relevance, and condition of a Formula, it can dramatically impact the quality and reliability of the final creation.  Should a player stumble upon an existing magic item, they may wish to empower it further or deconstruct it to learn its nature.  Also, as Formulas are rare and valuable, a Formula’s cost is 5x (or more) its item’s gold cost.</p><h5>Parameter Combinations</h5><p>An individual enchantment formula is for a given combination of parameters:</p><ul><li>Spell</li><li>Saturation</li><li>Spell Level</li><li>Quantity of Runes</li><li>Quantity of Nodes</li><li>Reactor Rate</li></ul><p>The Spell itself and whether the item is Saturated with that spell are considered Critical Parameters.  They must remain unchanged for a formula to qualify.  The others are considered Lesser Parameters.</p><h5>Formula Grades</h5><ul><li><strong>Complete</strong>: Successful creation of a magic item yields a Complete Formula for the given Critical Parameters and Lesser Parameters as well as for any combination of Lesser Parameters with lower values than those associated with the original enchantment.  It also qualifies as a Partial Formula for any other enchantment with the same Critical Parameters and improved Lesser Parameters.</li><li><strong>Partial</strong>: A failed attempt at a magic item results in a Partial Formula that is also a Partial Formula for all combinations of Lesser Parameters with the same Critical Parameters.</li></ul><h5>Formula Price Impacts</h5><ul><li><strong>Complete Formula</strong>: a complete formula halves the cost of an item</li><li><strong>Partial Formula</strong>: a partial formula leaves the cost of an item as it is in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a>.  Acquiring a Partial Formula is considered standard practice before attempting to craft an item.</li><li><strong>No Formula</strong>: doubles the gold cost of the item due to the research and testing time required.</li></ul><h4>Rarities and Costs</h4><p>Given a custom item’s Commision Cost, use the following to determine its rarity and maximum stats.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rarity</strong></td><td><strong>Gold Range</strong></td><td><strong>DC</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Common</td><td>0-500</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon</td><td>501-5k</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Rare</td><td>5k-50k</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Very Rare</td><td>50k-200k</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary</td><td>200k-1M</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Divine</td><td>>1M</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Resources</h4><p>All magic items require construction from an item of Masterwork quality. Each level lower in item quality increases the item DC by 5.</p><ul><li><strong>Masterwork</strong>: No DC penalty</li><li><strong>Fine</strong>: +5 to DC</li><li><strong>Standard</strong>: +10 to DC</li><li><strong>Mediocre</strong>: +15 to DC</li><li><strong>Crude</strong>: +20 to DC</li></ul><p>For certain Rare and above magic items, the DM may rule that special materials may be required from which the base non-magical item be constructed.</p><p>Additionally, Spell Scrolls and Potions require Spellpaper (5gp) and Inert Vials (10 gp) respectively, which can be purchased in a medium or larger city. Inert Vials can also be reused.</p><h4>Speeding Up Crafting</h4><p>To expedite the process of creating an item, a player may choose to employ others.  Any willing PCs (or allied and willing or contracted NPCs) that could individually craft the item may do so collectively without overhead costs.  In such a case where there are multiple crafters, one is considered the Lead Crafter and is the one to make the skill check against the item’s Difficulty Class to determine if creation is successful or not.  It is the Lead Crafter’s Caster Level that is also used in the affiliated <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a> to determine gold cost.</p><p>Should the lead crafter die, any unfinished items they have are to be converted to a %done number (1000gp of 2000gp would be 50% done).  A player may pick up a dead player’s (or steal a living one’s) partially complete magic item.  In such a case, its gold cost must be reevaluated using the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1haNL3t50BvkoqeXe7kK7csZ4fYS9GOFDG8YCDvf33q4/edit\">spreadsheet</a>.  If the item’s new owner were of higher level, it might only take the new owner 600gp to get the last 50% done.</p><p>As another option to speed up creation time, apprentices may be hired.  An apprentice performs 50gp of progress per day for 40+2d10 gold.  Apprentices cannot be fired after being hired.  If an apprentice is working on a Very Rare item, roll a d4.  If a 4, the apprentice attempts to steal it.  Apprentices cannot be trusted at all on items of Legendary or Divine rarity.</p><h4>Attunement and Isolation</h4><p>Magical items are inherently unstable as they contain forces that alter the world.  As such, while any object can be enchanted, most are not, and even of those that are, few include Isolation Circles due to the costs involved.  Without them, a user of a magic item that is either Saturated or contains Mana Reactors must attune to it, a one-hour process whereby their own River controls the flow of the Mana through the item, warming it up from a safe inactive state and stabilizing it.</p><p>Found in magical creatures in the forms of circular body parts such as the irises of animals, the horn of a unicorn, the feather stems of a coatl, or even the halo of an angel, Isolation Circles are entities that bind and protect magic from outside influence, forming a barrier that prevents interference in either direction.  Some creatures creatures could not survive without their evolved Isolation Circles.  The few unfortunate angels to have their halos destroyed usually detonate.  </p><p>Isolation Circles can also be added to creations, which is why most larger magical objects are circular in shape.</p><p>Isolation also makes dispelling magic harder; isolated objects have a +2 bonus to their difficulty class to dispel them, making the DC = 12+level. For items with multiple effects, the effects must be dispelled individually.</p><p>To make an item with an Isolation Circle, you must spend time and magic to master and barricade the object’s magic from the outside world. An isolated magical object requires the creator to expend five times as much gold coins worth of materials when creating the enchantment.</p><p>It is possible to create an item with multiple attunement requiring enchantments, but only one of them may be attuned to the user at any given time as the others will be in a safety shutdown state.  To have supplementary Reactors active, the supplementary Reactors must be Isolated.</p><h4>Improving Existing Items</h4><p>When altering the spell effects of an existing magic item, it must first be unattuned (if relevant).  Existing enchantments can be upgraded into greater versions of themselves with half the existing enchantment gold cost counting toward the upgraded gold cost if it is an improvement to an existing enchantment.  New enchantments must start from scratch, though as stated above, they must obey the Isolation rules if applicable.</p><p>Multiple magical items may be attached to one another, but be wary of Isolation causing problems in this case.

Each time you Attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of Ammunition. Drawing the Ammunition from a Quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended Ammunition by taking a minute to Search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee Attack, you treat the weapon as an Improvised Weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</p><h2>Amphibious [New]</h2><p>When used underwater, this weapon does not have disadvantage on attack rolls, and if it has the <em>Ammunition</em> or <em>Thrown</em> properties, it does not automatically miss beyond its normal range.</p><h2>Couched [New]</h2><p>If you are not mounted, this weapon also has the Two-Handed property.</p><h2>Dismounting [New]</h2><p>When an attack is made against a mounted combatant with this weapon, on a hit, you the target must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to half the damage dealt or be dismounted, landing prone within 5 feet of the mount.</p><h2>Extended Reach [New]</h2><p>This weapon adds 10 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it. This weapon also counts as a Reach weapon for the purpose of features that interact with the property.</p><h2>Finesse</h2><p>When making an Attack with this weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><h2>Handy [New]</h2><p>A hand, arm, or wrist fitted with this weapon still counts as a free hand.</p><h2>Heavy</h2><p>Small creatures have disadvantage on Attack rolls with this weapon.</p><h2>Inner Range [New]</h2><p>Attacks made by this weapon against targets this distance away or closer have disadvantage.</p><h2>Light</h2><p>This weapon can be used for <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/rules/Two-Weapon%20Fighting.md\">two-weapon fighting</a>.</p><h2>Loading</h2><p>Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of Ammunition from it when you use an Action, bonus Action, or Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><h2>Parrying [New]</h2><p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon in one hand and are holding this weapon in your off-hand that you are proficient with, if you do not attack with this weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to increase your AC by 1 until the start of your next turn.</p><h2>Range</h2><p>A weapon that can be used to make a ranged Attack has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When Attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the Attack roll. You can’t Attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.</p><h2>Reach</h2><p>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.</p><h2>Thrown</h2><p>You can throw this weapon to make a ranged Attack. If this weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that Attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee Attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a <em>Handaxe</em>, you use your Strength, but if you throw a <em>Dagger</em>, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the <em>Dagger</em> has the <em>Finesse</em> property.</p><h2>Two-Handed</h2><p>This weapon requires two hands when you Attack with it.</p><h2>Versatile</h2><p>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.</p><h2>Vigorous [New]</h2><p>Instead of using your Dexterity modifier for the damage roll of this weapon, you use your Strength modifier.</p>"}

{"_id":"XQMEvTr2LJJAEJdH","name":"Nature of Magic","permission":{"default":2},"folder":"","flags":{"owlmarble-magic":{"exportTime":"Sun Jun 05 2022 21:10:17 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)"}},"content":"<h2>Types of Magic</h2><p>On Faerun, the weave of magic takes several different forms, depending on its origin.</p><h3>Cosmic Magic</h3><p>The background magic of the cosmos that sometimes comes to infuse rocks or other natural features of reality. It is responsible for the divisions between planes. It is often chaotic and seemingly unpredictable, much like weather or volcanic activity. With sufficient study, it becomes general trends can be observed and future behavior can be extrapolated.</p><h3>Organic Magic</h3><p>Creatures that evolve sometimes develop an ability to manipulate magic intrinsically. Magical creatures such as Fae or Celestials fall into this category. When the magic of these creatures “rubs off” on the surrounding environment, it is often difficult to remove except by other organic magic that evolved to counter it.  Additionally, many creatures that use Organic Magic rely on it for their very survival and may quickly die when subjected to antimagic.</p><h3>Natural Magic</h3><p>Even among those life forms that have not properly come to harness magic, by their existence, they shape the magic around them. Druids give this magic direction, shaping the biosphere according to ways that benefit the creatures within it.</p><h3>Divine Magic</h3><p>When creatures become sufficiently suffused with magic, they ascend, and can be in multiple places at once.  Directly intervening in mortal affairs is difficult for gods, so instead they delegate power to their servants, trusting them to use the power wisely.</p><h3>Arcane Magic</h3><p>When magic is understood and treated as a resource that can be exploited, it is considered arcane.</p><h2>Mana Generation</h2><p>Mana, quantized arcane magic, can be used to cast spells and is an integral part of Organic Magic.  It appears on the Astral plane, flows through all other planes, and returns to the Astral plane.</p><h3>Organic Generation</h3><h4>Cantrips and Magical Effects</h4><p>Creatures that organically create Mana do so through a River and Dams within the creature’s soul.  As a creature becomes progressively attuned to magic, the River of magic that constantly flows through them grows wider, allowing greater effects.  The creature can then tap this flow to perform cantrips or other Organic effects.  Because these effects rely only on the baseline magic that flows through the creature, so long as the creature is not subject to antimagic, it may continue to produce such effects at will.  It is the increase in this river’s flow (formally known as Impulse) that powers higher grades of cantrips.</p><h4>Spell Slots and Leveled Spells</h4><p>Some creatures, in addition to their Rivers, also have Dams.  These allow the creature to retain larger volumes of the ambient magic around them, using this magic for surges known as leveled spells.  Another term for a Dam is a Spell Slot.  For a given magical effect, a threshold of magic is required.  </p><p>If a spell is provided less than its requisite threshold of Mana, the spell will fail to take shape.  Alternatively, a spell can be provided excessive Mana and still function.  Unfortunately many spells have not been crafted so as to make use of any excess Mana used to cast them.  For spells that do support this, the act of providing excessive Mana is called Up-Casting.</p><h4>Flow Alteration and Regeneration</h4><p>Most individuals that have Dams only refill them when they rest, but some are able to enter a state of meditation wherein they absorb ambient magic to refill them more rapidly.  Additionally, some others have the ability to transfer Mana between the pools behind the Dams, allowing them to merge smaller reservoirs into larger ones or split a large reservoir into several smaller ones.</p><h4>Isolation</h4><p>To survive in the presence of others of their kind, creatures possessing Organic magic can slightly suppress and synchronize the fields of magic around them.  In the most dramatic cases, creatures will even have evolved physical Isolation Rings just to survive.  In the case of Angels, were it not for their halos, they would spontaneously detonate due to the massive volumes of magic contained within them.</p><h3>Synthetic Generation</h3><h4>Mana Reactors</h4><p>It is possible to create an arcane object that stores Mana known as a Mana Reactor.  These devices are inherently unstable, unfortunately, and require a creature with Organic magic to manage them.  When a creature is not available, they enter a state of hibernation in which they are inert and Mana cannot enter or leave the reactor except in the presence of powerful magic or antimagic.</p><h5>Attunement</h5><p>While a creature is managing a reactor, the creature is said to be Attuned to the reactor.  Warming up or cooling down a reactor requires a one hour process during which a creature must attune or de-attune the item.  You must completely de-attune an item before attuning a new item in its place.  A creature may attune to up to three Reactors at once.</p><p>Also, an item could have multiple Reactors on it, but attempting to Attune to more than one of them at the same time would destroy the item.</p><h4>Mana Nodes</h4><p>These devices, integrated as part of a Mana Reactor, store Mana, much like Dams do within creatures.  Nodes are not entirely efficient, however, and some of the mana supplied to them flows through them.  This allows cantrips to feed off the excess energy of the reactor.  Such cantrips are known as parasitic cantrips or parasitic enchantments.</p><h4>Runes</h4><p>Runes are destructive, single use stores of mana.  Once consumed, they cannot be re-created.  Unlike reactors, they do not require attunement.  Less thorough implementations of runes will usually result in the substrate disintegrating.  Alternatively, drawing the runes as the stirring of a fluid will create a potion.  Runes do not require attunement.</p><h4>Saturation</h4><p>It is possible to turn an entire object into a reactor.  In these cases, the passive generation of the spell and its impulse can lead to triggering the enchanted spell an unlimited number of times.  A saturated enchantment cannot be Isolated, but it may feed parasitic cantrips.  As with reactors, the maximum number of grades of parasitic cantrips is equal to the saturation’s spell level.</p><h3>Enchantments</h3><p>When an item has an attached reactor and an output (such as a consumer), it is said to be enchanted.</p><h4>Flow Consumers</h4><p>Cantrips can feed off the excess mana flowing through a node.  The maximum number of grades of cantrips that can feed off a given reactor is equal to the reactor’s spell level.</p><h4>Reservoir Consumers</h4><p>Leveled spells can be fed from reservoirs of nodes.  Casting a spell consumes a single node’s charge.</p><h4>Reactor Isolation</h4><p>If a reactor is Isolated, parasitic cantrips cannot feed off its generated mana.</p>"}

Alternatively, an individual could claim an existing structure.</p><h3>Phases of Development</h3><p>Structures are built in three phases per room: Construction, Furnishing, and Decorating.</p><p>1. <strong>Construction</strong>: creating the exterior walls, floor, and roof.  A room must meet or exceed its size requirement to be functional.  This cost depends on size and material.</p><p>2. <strong>Furnishing</strong>: the costs below for facilities is this cost.  This includes any requisite equipment.</p><p>3. <strong>Decorations</strong>: Anything beyond the first two is decorative.</p><h3>Permissible Users</h3><p>Many functions of facilities are restricted.  An individual is considered a permissible user of a structure if they are the owner of the structure or have the permission of one who is.</p><h3>Underground Development</h3><p>The cost of a particular room is doubled if built directly below-ground.  For each additional 10 feet below-ground the floor of a room is, the room’s cost is increased by 50% of its original above-ground cost.  This affects all three phases of development, but does not affect maintenance costs as the number of hirelings is unchanged. Structures built below the surface of water are considered underground.</p><h3>Hard Points</h3><p>Certain structures are especially heavy or prone to experiencing force and require a solid foundation.  Such structures must be built on a \"hard point\" that covers at least as much area as they do.  Bedrock automatically counts as a hard point, but hard points can also be built from twice the normal cost of structural materials in the construction phase.  Such hard points must be atop another hard point, sunk into the ground, or otherwise sufficiently structurally integrated as the DM may allow.</p><h3>Extended Rests</h3><p>An extended rest is a week of light activity in your own structure without the stresses of being besieged unless the siege has gone on for so long and become so stale that it no longer impacts you.  If you expend your highest level spell slot or are reduced to ¼ of your hit points, this timer resets.</p><h3>Stronghold Actions</h3><p>A stronghold action is a unique action you can take, utilizing a room’s unique capabilities.  Once you use a Stronghold Action, you cannot use another until you complete an extended rest.</p><h3>Named Spells</h3><p>Melf’s Minute Meteors.  Zenith’s Starfall.  Azdregath’s Creeping Concoction.  Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion.  Raogon’s Hierarchy.  The greatest archmages have all created their own spells, and so can you!  When you create a spell, you may name it as you wish.  Will you spread the knowledge of your spells like Mordenkainen for the betterment of all?  Or will you hide your secrets like the Kyburns, fearing what Wish could do in the wrong hands?  Deploying a new spell in public will often get your name attached to it in the public’s mind, whether you want it there or not.</p><p>To create a named spell, select one of the below options when you are in an appropriate location (such as when you are a permissible user in an Arcanist’s Study):</p><ul><li><strong>Customize Existing</strong>: Devising a spell requires 4 weeks (working 8 hours a day for 5 days per week ) plus one week for every level of the root spell and expending 100gp a week.  At the conclusion of your research, roll on the Strongholds and Followers table on SAF24 to determine what headway you were able to make.  You may not customize a spell more than once, but after you have devised a given customization, you may choose to automatically apply it to any future upgrade attempts.  The resulting spell is always one level higher than the root spell.</li><li><strong>Create New</strong>: You may attempt to create a new spell whole-cloth, but doing so is dangerous, expensive, and time-consuming.  For spells of an inconsequential nature such as Damiana’s Antics, only a day may be required, but for spells of material significance, you must spend 8 weeks, plus an additional 2 weeks for every level of the spell.  You expend 500gp per work week.  At the DM’s discretion, the Strongholds and Followers table may be used for tweaking effects.  After all, magic is not a science.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><h4>Merchants</h4><p>See <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/xpc8eve6lfuqsb0/WH%20-%20Merchants.pdf?dl=0\">this</a> document for details on the merchants detailed in this document.</p><h4>Prior Art</h4><p>This document is heavily based upon the rules <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9uro4xgsffuset/WH%20-%20Fortresses.pdf?dl=0\">here</a>.</p><h2>Basic Facilities</h2><p>Basic facilities require no dedicated maintenance staff, unless otherwise specified.

Additionally, unless otherwise specified, a field requires regular sunlight to grow.</li></ul><li>Select a crop from the list below:</li><li>Tobacco: 1d20 bushels of inedible plant matter per year.  If you roll a 1, this field and the nearest three other tobacco fields within one mile all produce zero bushels due to a blight.

The portal appears upon the completion of building this structure.  The portal may be tuned to other such portals throughout the multiverse to allow transit between them or may be deactivated as an action by a permissible creature while within 5 feet of the portal.  A portal may be reactivated in the same way.  If a portal remains open for 1 week, a planar ship such as a Spelljammer will appear, bearing a random legendary merchant.  The merchant will be present for 7 days before taking their ship and departing.  7 days following that, another will appear and this cycle continues.  This structure generates 200d10gp worth of rare or exotic currencies every 30 days.  Such currencies might be electrum, astral diamonds, rare spell components, or similar.</li><li>Economics:</li><ul><li>Income: 25,200gp/yr = 200*10.5*12</li><li>Maintenance: 730gp/yr</li><li>Profit: 24,470gp/yr</li></ul></ul><h3>Garden</h3><ul><li>Size: 40x40</li><li>Cost: 2500gp</li><li>Benefits: Every day, the garden provides 10gp worth of enchanting or potion brewing components.  As the limiting factor in the growth of these plants is ambient magic, not resource acquisition, they cannot be blessed by natural spellcasters as fields can, instead requiring as their tender, a spellcaster.  Due to their absorption of local ambient magic, two Gardens cannot be placed closer to each other than 100 feet between their centers (60 feet from edges).</li><ul><li>Income: 3650gp = 10*365gp</li><li>Maintenance: 730gp</li><li>Profit: 2920gp/yr</li></ul><li>Alternatives: Greenhouse, Druid’s Grove</li></ul><h3>Gatehouse</h3><p><em>Requirement: must be built on a hard point</em></p><ul><li>Size: 40x40x20</li><li>Cost: 5000gp</li><li>Benefits: This room comes with an external door and internal portcullis.  A tunnel 40 feet long through the center of this structure between the two is lined with arrow slits and murder holes to allow defenders to safely attack intruders with ranged weapons.  The door’s statistics are determined by its dimensions and materials.  The portcullis is a steel grate offering half cover against ranged attacks and must be raised by one individual succeeding on a DC 23 Athletics check or two individuals simultaneously succeeding on a DC 16 Athletics check.  The portcullis weighs 1300 pounds.</li></ul><h3>Kitchens</h3><ul><li>Size: 20x30</li><li>Cost: 2500gp</li><li>Benefits: Generates 30 meals per day.  For each additional unskilled hireling working in the kitchen (maximum of 3), an additional 10 meals are generated.</li></ul><h3>Market Stalls</h3><ul><li>Size: 100x100</li><li>Cost: 2500gp</li><li>Benefits: Choose 3 merchants from the surrounding area to bestow your blessings upon.

A single skilled hireling can manage up to ten ranches without requiring additional hirelings.</p><h3>Ritual Circle</h3><ul><li>Size: 30x30</li><li>Cost: 2500gp</li></ul><p>Benefits: Rituals can be cast in half the usual time here.  If the ritual has an associated gold cost, the cost is halved when the ritual is performed in this room.  While here, permissible users have advantage on all rolls required by rituals.</p><h3>Siege Workshop</h3><ul><li>Size: 60x100x40</li><li>Cost: 5000gp</li><li>Benefits: Within this room, a team of 9 unskilled hirelings and 1 skilled hireling can construct siege equipment, detailed on DMG255.  To remain operational, a siege engine requires 1/10th its value in annual maintenance.</li><ul><li>Ballista: 1000gp, 15 days</li><li>Cannon: 1500gp, 15 days, knowledge of gunpowder</li><li>Mangonel: 3000gp, 30 days</li><li>Ram: 1000gp, 10 days</li><li>Siege Tower: 5000gp, 60 days</li><li>Trebuchet: 5000gp, 60 days</li></ul></ul><h3>Tower</h3><p><em>Requirement: must be built on a hard point</em></p><ul><li>Size: 20x20x20</li><li>Cost: 5000gp</li><li>Benefits: Attacks made by defenders in this structure against creatures at least 20 feet below them have their disadvantaged range doubled. If made of stone, this tower counts as a hard point.</li></ul><h3>War Room</h3><ul><li>Size: 20x20</li><li>Cost: 2500gp</li><li>Benefits: Soldiers friendly to the owner of this structure may have their journeys of up to 7 days planned within this room.  Doing so effectively doubles their overland speed.  A structure containing a war room that is under attack grants a 1d4 to hit for all creatures that would defend it.</li><li>Stronghold Action: <strong>Rally</strong> - creatures and units within 500 feet of your structure are emboldened, becoming immune to charm and fear effects for a number of minutes equal to the activating creature's charisma modifier (minimum 1).  After using this ability, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.</li><li>Alternatives: Bureaucrat’s Office, Map Room</li></ul><h2>Tool Facilities</h2><p>After constructing an empty room, you may create dedicated facilities for a tool type by filling it with valuable equipment.  The larger the room, the more expensive it is, but also the more stations there are.  Many facilities also confer additional benefits.  When you construct a room that supports multiple tool types, you must choose a single tool type for all the room’s stations.</p><p>Tool facilities require an unskilled hireling for maintenance.</p><h3>Stations</h3><p>A station is a workspace in a room for a craftsman, complete with tools, easily accessible raw materials, and more elaborate equipment than you would find it a normal tool kit that provides bonuses a basic kit would not.</p><p>A station can hold a single project at a time.  A project is something like the creation of a particular potion or forging an individual sword.</p><p>If you have more active projects in the room than stations, the extra projects do not gain the benefits of being in the dedicated facilities.  If a project does not spend all its active time at a station, it does not gain the benefits of it.  Collaborative projects require one station for each contributor working at a time.  At the DM's discretion, an especially large or challenging project may require multiple stations.  If a station is destroyed, it may be repaired by spending the cost of the corresponding kit and spending 8 hours.  If multiple kits are supported by the room, roll a die to determine which must be replaced.</p><h3>Room Types</h3><h4>Tavern</h4><ul><li>Tools Supported: Brewer’s Supplies</li><li>Benefits: Taverns are a gathering place for quests and rumors, dispensing 1d4-1 of each every seven days.  Further, the presence of a tavern gives the owner of the structure advantage on Persuasion checks with those who regularly use the tavern.  This is generally assumed to be most of those that live within the structure, as well as an assortment of those living nearby.  It generates 2d10 kegs of alcohol every 7 days worth 5gp each per staffed station.  Each station that is staffed by someone proficient in brewer’s supplies generates alcohol that is 10gp per keg instead.</li><li>Alternatives: Brewery, Brew House, Speak-Easy</li></ul><h4>Workshop</h4><ul><li>Tools Supported: Alchemist’s Supplies, Calligrapher’s Supplies, Carpenter’s Tools, Cartographer’s Supplies, Cobbler’s Tools, Cook’s Utensils, Forgery Kit, Glassblower’s Tools, Jeweler’s Tools, Leatherworker’s Tools, Mason’s Tools, Painter’s Tools, Potter’s Tools, Tinker’s Tools, Weaver’s Tools, Woodcarver’s Tools</li><li>Benefits: Items created in this room of the corresponding tool type have their DC lowered by 5 and items enchanted with the corresponding tool type do so at an accelerated rate of +50gp worth of materials per day.  All other types of crafting instead increase crafting speed by 50%.</li><li>Alternatives: Laboratory, Study, Studio, Shop, Smithy</li></ul><h4>Theater</h4><ul><li>Tools Supported: Disguise Kit, All Instruments</li><li>Benefits: Once per week, each stationed individual on staff generates 1d4sp in ticket sales, or 1d4gp in ticket sales if proficient in an instrument or the disguise kit.  If the character is proficient in Performance, the 1d4 becomes a 1d6.  Theaters occupy rooms are rectangular and are 3 times longer on one side than the normal room size.</li><li>Alternatives: Amphitheater, Lecture Hall, Balcony with Courtyard</li></ul><h3>Room Sizes</h3><ul><li>Small</li><ul><li>Size: 10x10 feet</li><li>Stations: 1</li><li>Cost: 2500gp</li><li>Time: 1 week</li></ul><li>Medium</li><ul><li>Size: 20x20 feet</li><li>Stations: 2</li><li>Cost: 4000gp</li><li>Time: 2 weeks</li></ul><li>Large</li><ul><li>Size: 30x30 feet</li><li>Stations: 5</li><li>Cost: 8000gp</li><li>Time: 3 weeks</li></ul><li>Huge</li><ul><li>Size: 40x40 feet</li><li>Stations: 15</li><li>Cost: 16000gp</li><li>Time: 4 weeks</li></ul></ul><h3>Propulsion [TODO]</h3><h2>Weaponry</h2><h3>Siege Emplacements</h3><p>Defensive siege engines produced by the Siege Workshop may be permanently installed for no additional cost beyond their construction cost.  Such permanent engines must be built upon a hardpoint of comparable size to the engine.  One week after construction completes, providing ample time to perform ranging testing, the engine gains advantage on all attack rolls.</p><h4>Magical Turrets</h4><h5>Light Turret</h5><p><em>Requirement: must be built on a hard point, see capable of 1st level magic</em></p><ul><li>Size: 5x5x5</li><li>Cost: 2,000gp</li><li>Benefits: No construction phase.

You may willingly disperse it early as an action.</li></ul></ul><h2>Room Modifications</h2><h3>Extradimensional</h3><p><em>Requirement: An owner or hireling that can cast 8th level spells.</em></p><ul><li>Cost: 20,000gp</li><li>Time: 30 days</li><li>Benefits: The room’s door is actually a portal to a pocket plane, containing the room itself.  The laws of time and gravity in the room are yours to set at time of creating this modifier.  Gravity can be between zero and twice its normal value.  Time can be half to double speed.</li></ul><h3>Hidden</h3><ul><li>Cost: 500gp</li><li>Time: 5 days</li></ul><p>Benefits: This modification hides a room from view such as hiding a doorway behind a bookcase activated by removing a particular book.  A creature that does not know of the hidden room must make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discover the presence of the hidden chamber, then a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to uncover how to enter once they are aware of its presence.</p><h3>Secret Passage</h3><ul><li>Cost: 1000gp</li><li>Time: 10 days</li><li>Benefits: This modification is built between two rooms to allow secret passage between them, similar to a hidden room.  As with a hidden room, the checks to discover a secret passage are the same.</li></ul><h3>Teleportation Rune</h3><p><em>Requirement: An owner or hireling that can cast 5th level spells</em></p><ul><li>Cost: 5000gp</li><li>Time: 20 days</li><li>Benefits: When this rune is first created, choose a command word.  Any creature that touches the rune and speaks the command word can instantly teleport to any other room of their choice within the same structure that also contains a copy of this rune as a modification in that room (or the same room if it has multiple copies of the rune as modifications).  All such runes within one structure share the same command word.</li></ul><h3>Trapped</h3><ul><li>Cost: Varies</li><li>Time: 7 days</li><li>Benefits: This contains one of the following traps, which you choose when you build this modification.  Details may be found on DMG122 and 123.</li><ul><li>Falling Net: 750gp</li><li>Fire-Breathing Statue: 1250gp</li><li>Pit, simple: 500gp</li><li>Pit, hidden: 1000gp</li><li>Pit, locking: 1500gp</li><li>Pit, spiked: 2000gp</li><li>Poison Darts: 1250gp</li><li>Poison Needle: 1500gp</li><li>Rolling Sphere: 2000gp</li><li>Sphere of Annihilation: 20,000gp.

Doing so costs 75% of the normal cost that would be required for an object unless that spell ordinarily targets objects or territory, in which case the cost is normal.  If the room to be warded is a crafting room, you do not gain the benefits of the crafting room itself.  Spells you may wish to cast on your structure include:</li><ul><li>Arcane Lock</li><li>Forbiddance</li><li>Glyph of Warding</li><li>Guards and Wards</li><li>Hallow</li><li>Mirage Arcane</li><li>Programmed Illusion</li><li>Skycastle</li><li>Symbol</li><li>Translocation Inhibitor</li><li>Teleportation Circle</li></ul></ul><h2>Construction Materials</h2><h3>Structural Panels</h3><p>Assumed to be 10x10x1 feet</p><h4>Loose Earth</h4><ul><li>AC: 5</li><li>HP: 120</li><li>Cost: 1sp</li><li>Time: 8 hours</li></ul><h4>Packed Earth</h4><ul><li>AC: 10</li><li>HP: 240</li><li>Cost: 2sp</li><li>Time: 16 hours</li></ul><h4>Log Wall</h4><ul><li>AC: 15</li><li>HP: 300</li><li>Cost: 3gp</li><li>Time: 3 days</li></ul><h4>Stone/Brick</h4><ul><li>AC: 16</li><li>HP: 360</li><li>Cost: 20gp</li><li>Time: 4 days (3 days quarrying, 1 building)</li></ul><h4>Steel</h4><ul><li>AC: 18</li><li>HP: 1200</li><li>Cost: 20,000gp</li><li>Time: 1 month</li></ul><h4>Adamantine</h4><ul><li>AC: 20</li><li>HP: 2400</li><li>Cost: n</li><li>Time: 1 month</li></ul><h4>Orichalcum</h4><ul><li>AC: 22</li><li>HP: Sufficient</li><li>Cost: Sufficient</li><li>Time: 1 year</li></ul><h3>Decorative Panels</h3><p>Assumed to be 12x12x0.1 inches</p><h4>Hemp Cloth</h4><ul><li>AC: 5</li><li>HP:: 1</li><li>Cost: 2cp</li><li>Time: 1 hour</li></ul><h4>Silk Cloth</h4><ul><li>AC: 5</li><li>HP:: 2</li><li>Cost: 5sp</li><li>Time: 1 day</li></ul><h4>Glass</h4><ul><li>AC: 5</li><li>HP:: 1</li><li>Cost: 10gp</li><li>Time: 1 day</li></ul><h4>Stained Glass</h4><ul><li>AC: 3</li><li>HP:: 3</li><li>Cost: 25gp</li><li>Time: 1 week</li></ul><h2>Hirelings</h2><p>Hirelings must be paid to continue to render their services.  If they go more than 7 days without pay after they should have been compensated, they will typically desert their post and search for employment elsewhere or begin to actively work against you.  While most facilities within a structure require a dedicated hireling for cleaning, maintenance, or operation, hirelings have uses beyond this.</p><p>For every 200x200x200 foot cube your structure occupies, not including fields, even partially, you must manage the area with 1 additional unskilled hireling.  For every 20 hirelings assigned a room or volume, you must also assign a supervisor hireling.  You may have supervisors for supervisors as needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Unskilled</strong>: 2sp/day</li><li><strong>Skilled</strong>: 2gp/day</li><li><strong>Slave</strong> (<strong>Unskilled</strong>): 75gp</li><li><strong>Slave</strong> (<strong>Skilled</strong>): 750gp</li></ul><h2>Further Funds</h2><p>Running a structure is an expensive enterprise.  As reasonable, you may secure funds through additional means.</p><h3>Tithes and Tuition</h3><p>If your structure is one that draws daily visitors in the form of worshippers or students, you can demand a fee for your services.  Note that excessive prices may drive some individuals away.  This could range from 1sp for a visit to a poor man’s shrine to 2gp daily for a world-class arcane education.  A shrine or temple may receive 50-250 visitors a day, while even a large college should expect a maximum of 100 students.  Luethia Academy, the premier arcane academy, charges 2gp a day and has 500 full-time students.  Many students attend on scholarship.</p><h3>Right of Passage</h3><p>Merchants and travellers through your lands must pay coin for the right to use the roads near your structure.  A small fine of 1cp is typical for minor roads, but major monopolistic trade routes could charge up to 5gp.  Traffic varies on most roads from 2 to 200 travelers.  Excessive tolls may lead to attempts to subvert them.</p><h3>Taxation</h3><p>Nearby villages could pay you tribute in exchange for military protection or bureaucratic operation.  Taxes could run from a reasonable 1cp per household daily to an exorbitant 2sp per household daily.  Note that excessive taxes may lead to revolt.</p><h3>Other Sources</h3><p>Creative players and dungeon masters may invent other ways of creating wealth and the DM should be as amenable as practicable to this.</p>"}

In the event of multiclassing, the individual class levels are used.  A 5 Cleric/5 Paladin can’t train recruits up to level 8 in either.  They could, however train recruits up to level 3 in both.</p><p>Most recruits will never amount to much.  Commoners are uneducated, untrained, and inexperienced.  Being a wizard, which requires a spell book to read from, is going to be very difficult if you are illiterate.  Similarly, if you grew up in a city, you’re going to have a very hard time being a ranger if you don’t have experience in the woods.  Sure, you can hand any man a spear and tell him to go forward, but proper training is more than that.  Because of this, use the Distributions table below to find out the frequency of a given trait in a population.  Note that a given NPC could potentially have multiple affinities, though this would be very rare.</p><h2>Affinity Distributions</h2><p>Use the following table to determine how many NPCs in a given area possess a given level of natural talent.  Note that the categories do not overlap.  Arcane Magic, for instance is 5, 2, 1.  That means that of the populace, 8% can learn at least the basics of arcane magic.  Note that these numbers are subject to the DM’s discretion.  In an urban hub, Rangers might be a rarity.  In a wealthy trading port, literacy might be more prevalent and so Arcane Magic might be more easily discovered.</p><ul><li><strong>Minimal Affinity</strong>: These individuals have the bare minimum skills to train in a given field.  NPCs with this level of affinity may not advance past level 1 in a class.</li><li><strong>Minor Affinity</strong>: These individuals possess legitimate talent for a given skillset.  Training them costs half the time.  NPCs with this level of affinity may not advance past level 3 of a class.</li><li><strong>Strong Affinity</strong>: These individuals possess a very great natural talent for the skill in question and could go far in life if they pursued this as a profession.  Training them takes a fourth of the time of those with only Minimal Affinity.  Player Characters are considered to have Strong Affinity for any class for which they meet the multiclass prerequisites.</li></ul><p><strong>Update</strong>: use the following for rolling all commoner stats: 5+(4d9)/4+racial.

Multiple trainers may work together to ensure all proficiencies are covered.  Officers must thereafter undergo an additional 100 days of training.</p><p>Just as with Affinity Distribution, these numbers are subject to DM alteration.  A port city might have a higher prevalence of sailors, while a desert oasis would likely have none.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Minimal Affinity</strong></td><td><strong>Minor Affinity (50%)</strong></td><td><strong>Major Affinity (25%)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cavalry</td><td>20%</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Infantry</td><td>70%</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Navy</td><td>40%</td><td>20%</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Officer</td><td>25%</td><td>5%</td><td>3%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After the completion of martial training, they become proficient in the corresponding entry below.  Additionally, officers may be assigned a group of up to 30 soldiers of a lower rank.  Any group with an officer has its AC and attack rolls increased by 1.  To have a higher-rank officer, there must be at least two of a lower rank, both at maximum capacity, beneath it.</p><ul><li><strong>Infantry</strong>: proficiency with shortsword, pike, shield, and medium armor.  They know how to march in formation and can be used as a phalanx, during which their AC increases by 2.</li><li><strong>Cavalry</strong>: proficiency with mounted combat, a reach weapon of choice, longswords, and shortbows.</li><li><strong>Navy</strong>: proficiency with naval combat, light armor, shortswords, scimitars, and cutlasses</li><li><strong>Officer</strong>: gains the Attack, Defend, and Retreat actions which may change the state of their commanded forces.  A commanded force may only be in one state at a time.</li><ul><li><strong>Attack</strong>: all commanded units receive an additional +1 to their attack rolls.</li><li><strong>Defend</strong>: all commanded units receive an additional +1 to their AC and have advantage on strength saving throws</li><li><strong>Retreat</strong>: all commanded units gain 15 speed when moving away from enemy forces but have disadvantage on charisma saving throws.</li></ul></ul><h2>Training Time</h2><p>The following list details the time required for training.</p><ul><li><strong>Level 0</strong>. <strong>200 days</strong>: Six months covers the absolute minimal basics of the class.  At this point, the trainees gains two cantrips, a cantrip and a proficiency, or a proficiency.  If the class is capable of learning Prestidigitation, it must be one of the cantrips learned.</li><li><strong>Level 1</strong>. <strong>200 days</strong>: With the basics covered, another six months is spent on actually becoming not terrible</li><li><strong>Level 2</strong>. <strong>300 days</strong>: At this point, only those with <strong>Minor</strong> or better affinity continue</li><li><strong>Level 3</strong>. <strong>500 days</strong></li><li><strong>Level 4</strong>. <strong>500 days</strong>: From here on, only those with <strong>Strong</strong> Affinity, also called Adepts may progress, though after level 4, they must rely on adventuring to progress in skill.</li></ul><p>Additionally, some conditions will reduce training time.</p><ul><li><strong>INT Score</strong>: for every point of INT the trainer has above 10, reduce training time by 1%</li><li><strong>WIS Score</strong>: for every point of WIS the trainer has above 10, reduce training time by 1%</li><li><strong>CHA Score</strong>: for every point of CHA the trainer has above 10, reduce training time by 1%</li><li><strong>Battlemaster</strong>: Battlemaster fighters can act as excellent trainers of Infantry, Fighters, Cavalry, and Navies, reducing training time by 15% and all others by 5%.</li><li><strong>Professors</strong>: Those with the Sage-Professor background can act as excellent trainers of Officers and Arcane Magic, reducing training time by 15% and all others by 5%.</li><li><strong>Acolytes</strong>: Those with the Acolyte background can act as excellent trainers for natural and divine magic, reducing training time by 20%.</li></ul><h2>Examples</h2><p>Thus, as an example in a town of 100 people, 5 will have minimal affinity for arcane magic.  Training the lot of them to even just be able to use the Firebolt and Minor Illusion would take 200 days, plus 5gp for each of the five of them, so the total cost will come to 5,000gp, a cost that is definitely not insubstantial.  If the trainer was a Professor with 20 INT and 20 CHA, however, training time would be reduced by `15+10+10=35%` which would shave off 70 days and 1,750gp, a very respectable amount.  If the Professor was tutoring select Strong Affinity students in a city, they would grow in power even faster.</p><p>In practice then, what this means is that you can trade 5000gp for 27.5 DPR.  If you wanted to do something like train an entire populace of a city to fight back against an ancient dragon by using Magic Missile spam, you would need to expend 400 days training 30 trainees to level 1 in Wizard, costing a grand total of 60,000gp.  Certainly, having an archmage professor would help with this, but it will only cut into it so far.  It will still be a monumentally expensive task.  That said, thereafter, you have a force of 30 wizards that can mass fire on even the most ancient of dragons to lay them low in one or two volleys.  When combined with the might of the party, it is very unlikely the dragon will survive even the first barrage.</p>"}

When the party would finish a long rest, the PCs perform a group survival check with a DC detailed below.  On a success, they long rest as normal.  On a failure, the party benefits from a short rest only, although provided they slept or tranced a sufficient amount, they do not take a level of exhaustion that would ordinarily be imposed for not completing a long rest.</p><p>`DC = zoneHostility - floor(manHours/partySize)`</p><p>At the DM’s discretion, certain externalities may further increase or decrease this DC.

Common examples include the arctic or deserts, but could also include forests filled with enemies.  Much of the Underdark would be captured by this level.</li><li><strong>DC25 - Extreme</strong>: areas where few dare to tread, these regions are usually unnatural, possibly caused by magic run amok or some sort of natural disaster that left the region all but uninhabitable.</li><li><strong>DC30 - Intolerable</strong>: regions so dangerous they enter myth, these regions are almost certainly the result of cataclysmic events or are claimed as the territory of evil beings of awesome power.

See the Player’s Handbook for he rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Druid.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells</strong>. You have the following spells prepared: @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.O20pMOMDFYQcotCY]{Cure Wounds}, @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.RIWvqHBmXOmAfsqQ]{Druidcraft}, @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.Spy6Z5ocXBaWXX67]{Produce Flame}, and @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.CIBFELTRKzow3rd3]{Thunderwave}. Alternatively, you can prepare two 0-level spells (also known as cantrips) and two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Primal spell list. Whenever you finish a Long rest, you can meditate and replace any spell you have prepared for this class with another Primal spell of the same level.</p><p>At higher levels in this class, you can prepare more spells, as shown on the Druid table. The numbers there determine the number of different spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 4th-level Druid, you can prepare three different 0-level spells, four different 1st level spells, and three different 2nd-level spells.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots</strong>. When you cast a prepared Druid spell, you expend a Spell Slot. The number of Spell Slots you have of 1st-level and higher is the same as the number of different spells you can prepare of each level, as shown on the Druid table. For example, as a 5th-level Druid, you have four 1st-level Spell Slots, three 2nd-level Spell Slots, and two 3rd-level Spell Slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong>. Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Druid spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong>. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class.</p><h3>Primal Channel [New]</h3><p>Primal magics infuse you. Tapping into that power, you can create various magical effects. you start with one such effect: <em>Wild Shape</em>, which is described below. Other Druid features give you additional Primal Channel effect options. Each time you use this ability, you choose which effect to create from among those you know.</p><p>You can use Primal Channel twice. You regain one use when you complete a Short Rest, and you regain all uses on a Long Rest. You gain additional uses at certain druid levels, as shown in the Primal Channel column of the Druid table.</p><p>If a Primal Channel effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals your Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.</p><h3>Primal Channel: Wild Shape [Updated]</h3><p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the <em>Shapechanger</em> creature type, and you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast.</p><p>Your druid level determines the types of beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Forms table (below), with higher levels increasing the options available to you.</p><p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p><p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p><ul><li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. If you would make a Constitution check or save, use your Wisdom check or save instead.</li><li>When you transform, you gain temporary hit points based on the form and your druid level.</li><li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast, as in the case of @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.qWG4QUlNJty4p9RQ]{Call Lightning}.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Equipment that is not magically enchanted for it doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. If an item is cursed, the DM decides what becomes of it in your new form.</li></ul><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSjJ25RDUV4\">Treantmonk</a></p><h4>Beast Forms</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Druid Level</strong></td><td><strong>New Forms Available</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#scout\">Scout</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#hunter\">Hunter</a></td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#stalker\">Stalker</a></td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/classes/druid/Beast%20Forms.md#titan\">Titan</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Beast Spells [Updated]</h3><p>Beginning at 17th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape.

These benefits last for one hour or until you are incapacitated.</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Environment</strong></td><td><strong>Benefits</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Arctic</strong></td><td>You are immune to cold damage, and if an ally would die while within 10 feet of you or if you move such an ally's corpse is within range, their remains are preserved indefinitely for the benefit of spells such as @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.IDabPHxEYjXKwclW]{Revivify}.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Coast</strong></td><td>When you choose to, you can walk on water and other liquids as if they were was a solid surface.

If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p><p><strong>Arctic</strong></p><blockquote><table

If you do, your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p><h3>Ki [Updated]</h3><p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki.

When you gain a new kensei weapon, your critical hit range with all your kensei weapons increases by 1.</p><blockquote><h5>Maximixed Crit Dice House Rule Interaction</h5><p>If you play with the common house rule where critical hits add the size of the die instead of doubling it, you should remove the initial critical hit range increase Kensei receives at level 3.</p></blockquote><h5>Agile Parry [Updated]</h5><p>If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself  if it is a melee weapon.

For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.</p><h3>Sorcerous Fortitude</h3><p>As an action, you can spend any number of mana points up to your sorcerer level to roll a d4 for each point expended.  You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled that last until the end of your next long rest.</p><h2>Flexible Magic</h2><p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist magic to suit your needs.  You gain two Metamagic options, detailed at the end of this document.  You gain another Metamagic option of your choice at 10th level, and a final one at 17th level.  When you gain a level in Sorcerer, you can replace any or all of your Metamagic selections with new ones except for your origin Metamagics, detailed below.</p><p>You can only use one metamagic option on a spell unless otherwise noted.</p><h3>Origin Metamagic</h3><p>Starting at 3rd level, in addition to your Metamagic selections, your sorcerous origin lends itself to twisting your spells in certain ways.  The metamagics in the corresponding table below are known automatically by you starting at the prescribed levels and cannot be traded when you increase your sorcerer level.  They do not count against your number of metamagics known.  If you already have a metamagic when it becomes known to you through your origin, your known metamagic is freed and you may select another.</p><h4>Aberrant Mind</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Distracting Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Gruesome Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Repulsive Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Abyssal Bloodline</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Distant Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Careful Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Gruesome Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Astral Magic</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Extended Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Distant Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Subtle Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Clockwork Soul</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Scanning Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Quickened Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Shielding Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Divine Soul</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Helping Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Healing Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Scourging Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Draconic Bloodline</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Penetrating Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Empowered Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Swarming Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Shadow Magic</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Obscuring Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Subtle Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Harvesting Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Storm Sorcery</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Rupturing Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Blinding Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Scarring Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Wild Magic</h4><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sorcerer Level</strong></td><td><strong>Metamagic</strong></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Disrupting Spell</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>Twinned Spell</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Annihilating Spell</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Metasorcery</h2><p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended mana points when you finish a short rest.  Additionally, the mana point price of the first metamagic you apply to a spell is reduced by 1.</p><blockquote><p>Mana points and sorcery points have a 1:1 relationship, so the change here is the price reduction.</p></blockquote><h2>Metamagic Options</h2><h3>Accelerating Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that targets one or more creatures or vehicles, you can spend 1 mana point to increase the speed of the targets of the spell by 10 until the end of your next turn.  During this time, their movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p><h3>Annihilating Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that deals damage, you may spend a mana point to create a rending magical aura.  Any creatures or nonmagical objects that are reduced to 0 hit point by the spell are annihilated, bursting into specks of light before vanishing and leaving no trace.  When using this metamagic to annihilate a creature, any nonmagical objects it wears or carries are annihilated as well.</p><h3>Blinding Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that includes an attack roll, you may spend 2 mana points to imbue the spell with a blinding radiance.  When a creature is hit by an attack roll from the spell, it is blinded until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Careful Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force.  To do so, you spend 1 mana point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 creature).  A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.</p><h3>Disrupting Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell, by expending 2 mana points, you can compel all affected creatures to immediately make a Concentration check against your spell save DC.</p><h3>Distant Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 mana point to double the range of the spell.</p><p>When you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 mana point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p><h3>Distracting Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell, by expending 2 mana points, you can imbue it with an illusory effect that draws the attention of creatures affected by it, distracting them from other nearby dangers.  Once a creature is struck by a spell attack from the spell or fails its initial saving throw against the spell, the next attack roll against it by a creature other than you before the beginning of your next turn has advantage.</p><h3>Echoing Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage in an area of effect without secondary effects, you can spend a number of mana points equal to the spell’s level to cause the energy of the spell to linger.  At the start of your next turn, the lingering spell’s damage applies again to the same area, imposing any corresponding saving throws or making any relevant attack rolls.  Creatures damaged by the echo receive only half damage.  For instance, if the spell would ordinarily include a saving throw for half damage, a creature that succeeds on the echo’s saving throw would receive a quarter of the original damage.</p><h3>Empowered Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 mana point to reroll a number of dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).  You must use the new rolls.</p><p>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p><h3>Extended Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 mana point to double its duration, up to a maximum of 24 hours.</p><h3>Gruesome Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can cause the wounds it causes to be especially heinous by expending 3 mana points.  Creatures within 10 feet of a creature when the creature is damaged by the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Harvesting Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a damage-dealing spell, you may expend 2 mana points to link the life force of the targets to your own.  For each small or larger creature damaged by the spell, you gain 1d4 temporary hit points, to a maximum of twice your sorcerer level, that last until the end of your next long rest.</p><p>If the spell has damage-dealing effects that are not instantaneous, a creature can only be harvested once, and if additional creatures are later harvested by the spell, the temporary hit points gained from them are added to any remaining temporary hit points from this effect.</p><p>The temporary hit points provided by different uses of this metamagic do not stack.</p><h3>Heightened Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 mana points to give the creature disadvantage on its first saving throw against the spell.</p><h3>Helping Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature at the spell’s current level, you may expend 2 mana points to assist that creature.  Until the end of the creature’s next turn, the creature has advantage on any attack rolls or ability checks it makes.</p><h3>Obscuring Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast an instantaneous spell with an area of effect, you may expend 2 mana points to create magical darkness in its wake that fills the same area of effect and lasts until the start of your next turn.  For the purpose of removing it, the magical darkness is considered to be of a level equal to the level of the spell that was cast.</p><h3>Penetrating Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a damaging spell that targets only one creature, you may spend 3 mana points to attempt to overwhelm its innate defenses. If the creature has resistance to the damage type of the spell, it loses that resistance until the end of your next turn, including against the damage of the triggering spell.</p><h3>Quickened Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 mana points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.</p><h3>Reinforcing Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and that creature is not you, you may expend a number of mana points up to half your sorcerer level, rounded down.  For each mana point expended, the creature gains 1d4 temporary hit points.</p><h3>Repulsive Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast an instantaneous leveled spell with an area of effect and an initial saving throw, you can spend 2 mana points to unleash a shockwave along with the other effects of the spell. Creatures that fail the initial saving throw of the spell are pushed directly away from the origin of the area of effect.  If a creature encounters an obstacle along the way, their movement stops and they receive no damage. The distance they are pushed is equal to 5 times the spell level, but may not be pushed beyond the edge of the area of effect.  The shockwave can be heard to a number of feet equal to 100 times the spell level.</p><h3>Rupturing Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell with an area of effect, you may spend 1 mana point to cause the area to become difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Scanning Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature at the spell’s current level, you may expend 1 mana point to learn one of the following traits of the creature:</p><ul><li>Armor Class</li><li>Proficient Skills</li><li>Strongest Saving Throw</li><li>Weakest Saving Throw</li><li>Alignment</li><li>Hit Dice Count</li></ul><p>You may apply this metamagic to a spell even if you have already applied a metamagic to the same spell.</p><h3>Scarring Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a damage-dealing spell, you may expend 1 mana point to cause the wounds it creates to resist healing.  A creature that receives damage from the spell cannot heal until the end of your next turn.  You may apply this metamagic to a spell even if you have already applied another to the same spell.</p><h3>Scourging Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that deals damage, you may spend 2 mana points to change the spell’s element to Radiant or Necrotic, or you may expend 3 mana points to change the spell’s element to Force.</p><h3>Secret Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that does not summon a creature or turn one creature into another, you may spend 2 mana points to cause any products of the spell to be invisible for the duration of the spell.</p><h3>Seeking Spell [TCOE]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that requires a spell attack or forces a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 mana point to ignore the effects of partial cover.</p><h3>Shielding Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature at the spell’s current level, you may expend 1 mana point to give the creature half cover against all attacks and dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Snaking Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast a line spell, you may spend a mana point to add a single bend along the length of the line to change its direction up to 90 degrees. You may apply this metamagic more than once, but each time you do so, the cost increases by 1, and sequential bends may be no closer together than the width of the line.</p><h3>Subtle Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 mana point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.</p><h3>Swarming Spell [New]</h3><p>When you cast Magic Missile or an instantaneous spell with one or more ranged spell attacks made on the same turn with no secondary effects, you may pay the mana cost of the spell a second time to create twice as many bolts of energy; using this with a cantrip costs 1 mana point.</p><p>Half of the attacks behave as normal for the spell, while the other half fire at the beginning of your next turn unless you have been incapacitated.  If a target no longer meets the targeting requirements for the spell, bolts targeting it deal no damage.  You select the targeting of each attack when you initially cast the spell.</p><h3>Transmuted Spell [TCOE]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can expend 1 mana point to choose a different element from that list.</p><h3>Twinned Spell [SRD]</h3><p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of mana points equal to the spell’s level (cantrips count as 1) to target a second creature in range with the same spell.</p><p>To be eligible, the spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level.  For example, Magic Missile and Scorching Ray aren’t eligible, but Ray of Frost and Chromatic Orb are.</p><h3>Unerring Spell [TCOE]</h3><p>When you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 mana points to reroll the attack roll.  You can use this metamagic even if you have already used metamagic on the same spell.  If the spell has multiple attack rolls, you apply this metamagic individually for each attack roll.</p><h2>Sorcerous Origins</h2><h3>Abyssal Bloodline [New]</h3><p>Your innate magic comes from the untameable chaos and fury of the Abyss.  You might have a demonic ancestor or endured a ritual performed by a demonic cult that granted you a sliver of their dark lord’s power.  Perhaps you once fell through a portal to that dread realm, or maybe it was even a willing voyage.  Whatever the cause, this magic within you hungers for release in whatever way it can achieve.</p><h4>Contact Magic [New]</h4><p>Starting when you choose this Sorcerous Origin at 1st level, your Sorcerer spells have their ranges reduced to 5 feet unless the range is already Touch or Self or the spell causes you to make a melee spell attack.  If the spell causes you to make a ranged spell attack, it instead becomes a melee spell attack.</p><p>When you cast a damaging Sorcerer spell in which you make a melee spell attack, you may add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to the attack’s damage roll the first time each affected creature is damaged by your spell.  A creature cannot receive this extra damage more than once per turn.</p><p>If you cast a cantrip that causes you to make a melee spell attack that can affect only one creature and has multiple damage dice, you can split the spell’s magic.  Make a number of attacks equal to the number of dice of the cantrip.  On a hit, the target suffers damage of the spell’s type equal to a single damage die, as well as any secondary effects of the spell.  The attacks can target the same or different creatures.</p><h4>Abyssal Shroud [New]</h4><p>Starting at 1st level, When you damage a creature with a melee attack from a Sorcerer spell you cast, your magic siphons away some of the target’s vitality, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) plus the spell’s level (cantrips count as 0).  These temporary hit points last until the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>Additionally, if you are forced to make a saving throw against your own spell, you succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Contact Magic</strong> plus <strong>Abyssal Shroud</strong> means Abyssal Sorcerer spells can behave very differently from their defaults.  Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Shocking Grasp:</strong> would deal bonus damage from your Charisma modifier and would grant you temporary hit points.  At higher levels, this could deal 1d8+CHA to multiple creatures and remove all their reactions.</li><li><strong>Fire Bolt:</strong> would attack as a melee spell attack with a range of five feet, adding your Charisma modifier to the damage and granting temporary hit points.  Again, at higher levels, this could target multiple creatures.</li><li><strong>Green-Flame Blade:</strong> GFB would not gain bonus damage from your Charisma modifier, but it <em>would</em> recharge your shroud.</li><li><strong>Fireball:</strong> rather than having a range of 150 feet, the range would drop to 5 feet, but the radius would remain unchanged, causing the caster to include themselves in the blast.</li><li><strong>Lightning Bolt:</strong> because Lightning Bolt already has a range of self, its behavior would be entirely unchanged.</li><li><strong>Animate Objects:</strong> the conjured objects are creatures, meaning their attacks are not yours, so this spell does not benefit from <em>Abyssal Shroud</em>.</li><li><strong>Spectral Horde:</strong> the illusions are not creatures, meaning their attacks <em>are</em> yours, so this spell <em>does</em> recharge <em>Abyssal Shroud</em>.</li><li><strong>Blade of Disaster:</strong> the blade would appear beside you, but because you are making a melee spell attack through it, it would deal bonus damage from your Charisma modifier and would grant you temporary hit points.</li></ul><p>You may wish to work with your DM to rename particular spells to reflect the point-blank nature of your spellcasting.  For instance, @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.ULadiKneExZ62foM]{Fire Bolt} might become <em>Fire Claw</em>.</p></blockquote><h4>Unnatural Movement [New]</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, your body begins to acclimate to the churning energies within, allowing you to channel them into bursts of speed.  As a bonus action, you can take the Dash action.  Attacks of opportunity against you during this bonus action’s movement have disadvantage.  You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).  You regain all uses of this feature on a short or long rest.</p><h4>Cloak of Chaos [New]</h4><p>Starting at 14th level, your body has nearly mastered the power within it, granting immunity to the effects of your own spells unless you wish to be affected.</p><p>Additionally, your agility improves to make you all but untouchable when you’re on the move.  When you use your Unnatural Movement feature, you become untargetable by attacks of opportunity until the end of your current turn.</p><h4>Hunger of the Abyss [New]</h4><p>At 18th level, you have mastered the power within you, granting you access to a nearly limitless well of vitality.  When you cast a Sorcerer spell and it first damages a creature, you can expend a number of hit dice up to the level of the spell.  For each hit die expended in this way, you regain hit points equal to the size of the die.</p><h3>Astral Magic [New]</h3><p>The magic that suffuses your soul stems from the magic of the Astral Plane itself where thought alters reality.  This power allows you to summon reinforcements for your allies and obstacles for your enemies.  Perhaps you fell through a planar portal to the Astral plane, you grew up next to a wizard’s lab with little concern for the fabric of reality around it, or you were pulled into the dream of a powerful psionic being.</p><h4>Summoning Spells</h4><p>Drawing on the power within your soul, you can develop the skills necessary to conjure allies from thin air.  The following spells count as Sorcerer spells for you.</p><h5>Summon Spells Table</h5><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Spell Level</strong></td><td><strong>Spells</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.MomKjooFB93nfBjs]{Summon Servant}</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.7mzJYQ317Ou6d03t]{Summon Beast}</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.yWUR4BIpasp9fFfR]{Summon Shadowspawn}, @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.Zd3QPmq7iQmdCcgx]{Summon Undead}</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.6gHCga5REG52cwJf]{Summon Aberration}, @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.QZhDXHVBDzB8jnJB]{Summon Elemental}</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.j4oWDdxQLJEDfbUB]{Summon Fiend}</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Summoned Servant [New]</h4><p>When you choose this sorcerous origin at 1st level, you learn the spell @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.MomKjooFB93nfBjs]{Summon Servant}.  It does not count against the number of spells you know.  When you increase in level, you cannot exchange this spell for another.</p><h4>Enhanced Creations [New]</h4><p>When you create a creature from one of the spells in the Summoning Spells table, select one of the following ways to enhance it:</p><ul><li>Using its bonus action, the summoned creature can move a number of feet equal to 5 times your Charisma modifier (minimum 5 feet).</li><li>The summoned creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your Sorcerer level, rounded down (minimum 1).</li><li>If it does not already possess an attack action, it gains a melee weapon attack using your spell attack modifier to hit.  On a hit, the attack does 1d4 plus your proficiency bonus as piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, with the DM selecting an element appropriate for the form.  If the summoned creature already has an attack, you can choose to use your proficiency bonus in place of its Strength or Dexterity for the damage roll.</li><li>When the creature deals piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage, the damage counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances to nonmagical attacks.</li></ul><p>Starting when you reach 6th level, you can select two options at once instead of one.</p><h4>Flash Creations [New]</h4><p>Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can spend 2 mana points to create a translucent barrier of magical force at an unoccupied point you can see within 60 feet that lasts until the end of your next turn.</p><p>The barrier takes the form of a plane of magical force 5 feet by 5 feet and is one inch thick.  It may be oriented in any way you choose.  The force barrier has an AC of 10 plus your Charisma modifier, a number of hit points equal to your Sorcerer level, and sheds dim light in a 10 foot radius.</p><p>It resists motion, but for every 1000 pounds of force applied to it it moves 5 feet per round.  As an action, a creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC to either reorient it or move it 5 feet.</p><h4>Shielded Summons [New]</h4><p>Beginning at 14th level, your ability to instantly create barriers has grown to the point that you can use it to defend your allies.  After damage has been rolled and declared for an effect targeting a creature you summoned, but before the damage is applied, you can use your reaction to expend any number of mana points to shield your summoned creature.  For each mana point expended, the damage the summoned creature would receive is reduced by 10.</p><h4>Twin Summons [New]</h4><p>Once you reach 18th level, when you cast one of the spells from the Summoning Spells table, in place of applying a metamagic, you can expend additional mana points equal to the level of the spell to summon two creatures from the spell instead of one.  The two creatures can be the same archetype or different archetypes.  The two creatures appear at unoccupied target positions of your choice that you can see within range.</p><h3>Shadow Magic Updates</h3><h4>Eyes of the Dark [Updated]</h4><p>Starting at 1st level, you have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.</p><p>When you reach 3rd level in this class, you gain the ability to see through magical darkness you create.</p><h3>Wild Magic Updates</h3><h4>Tides of Chaos [Updated]</h4><p>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.  Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p><p>Any time you cast a leveled spell, you gain a level of Instability.  After the spell has been cast and any instantaneous effects have been applied, roll a d10.  If you roll equal to or less than your level of Instability, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table and reset your Instability to 0.  You then regain your use of Tides of Chaos, if applicable.  When you finish a long rest, reset your Instability to 0.</p><h4>Spell Bombardment [Updated]</h4><p>When you cast a spell that triggers Wild Magic, you can immediately cast a cantrip, no action required.</p>"}

If you do, any time a class feature references your charisma, use your intelligence instead.</p><hr /><h3>Split Magic [New]</h3><p>Starting at 5th level, when you cast a damaging cantrip with a grade higher than 1 with a spell attack or that compels a saving throw, you can split the spell’s magic.  Instead of casting the spell at your normal grade, you can rapidly cast it at grade 1 a number of times equal to the grade you normally cast it at.

You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p><hr /><h2>Pact Boons</h2><p>If your pact boon is an item, it counts as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p><hr /><h3>Pact of the Blade [Updated]</h3><hr /><p>When you accept this pact boon, you gain proficiency in medium armor and shields.</p><p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p><p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p><p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p><p>If you later surrender this pact boon through the Eldritch Versatility feature, you lose proficiency in medium armor and shields if you have no other source for them.</p><hr /><h3>Pact of the Flesh [New]</h3><hr /><p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NotTheSmooze\">u/NotTheSmooze</a>’s Pact of the Skin.</p><p>When you accept this pact boon, your patron crafts a new body for you.  The body can be any humanoid species, sex, or appearance.  If your species changes, your traits and ability scores change to reflect this.  Somewhere on your body is the tattooed, scarred, or branded symbol of your patron.  This could be in a prominent location such as your forehead, or hidden somewhere.</p><p>In this new body, you gain several benefits:</p><p>Your armor class becomes 12 + your Charisma modifier.  If you would wear armor, you can choose to use this armor class instead.

Otherwise, it is considered uncontrolled.</p><h2>Translocation Rules</h2><p>A translocation effect is any effect that instantaneously (or at least instantaneously as far as combat is concerned) transports you to a different location.  Translocation effects can be divided into 3 categories: <em>Portals</em>, <em>Teleports</em>, and <em>Conveyances</em>.  A few examples are provided for each.</p><ul><li><strong>Portals</strong>: any effect where a gateway is created that allows for rapid travel between two points.</li><ul><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.llCNkViVZxDEgeO2]{Arcane Gate}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.YaXu8QxRSOJcNFF2]{Gate}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.aUP4OQzDR9awLKUT]{Transport via Plants}</li></ul><li><strong>Teleports</strong>: any effect that instantaneously alters a target’s location, as if someone had pulled up the universe’s dev console and done JohnDoe.setLocation(x,y,altitude,plane).</li><ul><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.fMGdq3SXkO4qWDRv]{Dimension Door}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.2ZjLI4HerqaenGir]{Teleport}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.rvnpeVmcUktWXJd9]{Plane Shift}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.P4FSCdie8GuPWCvV]{Word of Recall}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.doawO6z9xyFIso7z]{Blink}</li></ul><li><strong>Conveyances</strong>: any effect that causes the target to physically travel to a location at extremely high speed such that it is nearly instant, usually involving some manner of temporary discorporation.</li><ul><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.ryUhY0EwrDQzXgCu]{Warp Strike}</li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.UKiDaiXGEt6sd7MS]{Misty Step}</li><li><em>Blessing of the Raven Queen</em></li><li>@Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.TGpIYiEt4BvEl6X1]{Tree Stride}</li><li><em>Fiery Conveyance</em></li></ul></ul><h2>Illusion Rules</h2><ul><li>Illusions are divided into <em>Figments</em> and <em>Glamors</em>.  An individual illusion spell may have either or both.</li><li>Figments and Glamors, unless otherwise specified, are intangible and immune to all damage and conditions.</li><li>Figments create a shape in the spellcaster’s design of choice that interacts with and possibly emanates harmless sensory information of one or more types, as specified by the spell.  If enough light, sound, scent, taste, or heat, sufficient to directly harm a creature, is directed at a figment, the effect penetrates the figment and only harmless levels are interacted with by the figment.</li><li>Figments are classified as either creatures or objects for the purpose of targeting, depending on what they appear to be.  A creature that knows a figment is an illusion may always target it as if it were a spell effect.</li><li>Glamors alter the harmless sensory effects associated with a creature, object, or spell effect.</li><li>A creature presented with an illusion assumes the illusion is real until given specific cause to disbelieve.  Seeing the illusion appear in the first place is not cause to disbelieve unless a creature has specific prior knowledge to expect illusions, in which case it disbelieves if its passive Investigation exceeds the spell save DC.</li><li>A creature who questions an illusion can make an Investigation check against the caster's spell save DC as an action.  If the creature succeeds, it knows the illusion for what it is.  The caster of an illusion always knows the illusion for what it is.</li><li>Illusions of animate objects and creatures have an Armor Class equal to the spell save DC of their creator while figments of inanimate objects have an Armor Class of 2.  Creatures that “hit” an insubstantial illusion discover it as such when their attack passes through it.</li><li>Illusions automatically succeed on all saving throws.</li><li>A revealed Figment or Glamor does not dissipate, become faint, sound hollow, or otherwise degrade unless otherwise specified in the spell.</li><li>If a creature has Truesight, the creature automatically knows if there is an illusion in its field of view and can perceive both the illusion and anything hidden by it.  It behaves as if it has already succeeded on the investigation check.</li><li>A Figment or Glamor may be reinforced by shadow material from the Shadowfell and so become semi-real.  Such an illusion becomes known as a Shadow and holds up to physical inspection, taking on all properties of the emulated object or creature, but remains totally controlled by its creator.  Shadows cannot be used as spell components.  If a shadow is reduced to zero hit points, it dissipatess.</li></ul>"}

It may emit light, but may be no brighter than shedding bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond the bright radius.</p><p>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

At the end of a creature's turn, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each leech attached to it.</p><p>Constructs, undead, plants, and creatures that lack blood are immune to this damage.  The leeches last for the duration of the spell and are immune to damage, but a creature can use its action or a 1-cost legendary action to remove all leeches from itself or an ally within five feet of it.  Once removed, leeches fall to the ground, wither, and die.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level above 1st that this spell is cast at, one additional leech is conjured.

The glamor takes the form of adding apparent depth to an object, such as making a room appear off to the side of a hallway or making a pit seem to appear in the floor.  The glamor and the illusory room within may be any shape you desire, but cannot be larger than 10 feet by 10 feet and the illusory room cannot be more than 20 feet deep.  The parallax room created by this spell may be any solid color of your choice and light interacts with the glamor so as to make the room seem real.  For example, if this spell is used to create a pit, a creature standing at the edge would be able to see all the way down, whereas a creature farther back would not be able to see what is at the bottom of the illusory pit.</p><p>For the duration, the interior of the room becomes a valid target location for other illusion spells.  If you apply another casting of this spell to an existing parallax room, you may extend the room by the same rules as before.  When this spell ends for any reason, anything inside it or any parallax rooms that branched off it are safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space outside the terminated glamor.</p><p>If this spell is subjected to Illusory Reality, this room and any that branch from it become real and are extradimensional.  If this expires while a creature or real object is inside it, the creature or object is safely shunted outside, as if the spell had ended.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When cast with a 6th level spell slot or higher, the room lasts until dispelled.  If when you cast it in this way, you subject it to Illusory Reality, it is real until dispelled.</p><h2>Reassemble</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bottle of glue)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You reassemble the fragments of a destroyed inanimate object that would fit within a 5-foot cube so long as the fragments are not being restrained from returning to the target location and are within 100 feet.  An object repaired by this spell will have 1 hit point and will not be structurally sound.  If the target was an undead or construct, the body will be restored, but it will not be reactivated.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each slot higher than 1st, the side length of the cube increases by 5 feet.</p><h2>Repair</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a wrench)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You heal an inanimate object or construct for 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level higher than 1st, this spell heals an additional 1d8.</p><h2>Scroll Shredder</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action Ritual</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Artificer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You touch a document transcribed on paper, parchment, or spellpaper. The document then winds itself up, and a magical wax seal that glitters with internal light appears on it. Upon a creature breaking the seal, a timer begins to count down, which is displayed alongside the text of the document as an illusion. At zero, the parchment disintegrates itself. You select the length of the timer when you cast this spell.</p><h2>Silvery Barbs</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Enchantment</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within range succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard</li></ul><p>You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.</p><p>You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (including yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute.</p><p>This spell has no effect on the triggering creature if the triggering event was a critical hit, use of a legendary resistance, or a saving throw imposed by a spell of a higher level.</p><h2>Slick</h2><p><em>replaces Grease</em></p><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of butter or ice)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Wizard</li></ul><p>You cover a 10-foot square within range in a slippery inert substance such as grease or ice.

Roll 8d4, the total of which is the number of hit points of creatures this spell can effect.  Creatures within a 20-foot radius sphere of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points.</p><p>Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or another creature uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.  Subtract each creature's current hit points from the total before moving onto the next-lowest hit point creature.  If a creature has more remaining hit points than the remaining total, the creature is not affected.</p><p>Undead and creatures immune to charms aren't affected by this spell.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 5d4 for each slot above 1st.

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p><p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p><p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p><p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p><p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: If cast with a 3rd level slot, the duration increases to 10 minutes. If cast with a 4th level slot, the duration increases to 1 hour. If cast with a 5th level slot, the duration increases to 4 hours.

For the duration, when the target damages another creature, leaving the victim below one quarter of its health, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw to resist dropping to 0 hit points and begin dying.  The DC is equal to 10 or half the damage dealt (rounded down), whichever is higher.</p><p>Additionally, when the target creature makes a ranged or spell attack, it can elect to deal non-lethal damage.</p><p>Finally, when the target heals another creature, the healed creature heals for an additional amount equal to the target's proficiency bonus.</p><h2>Dig</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a miniature silver shovel worth 5gp)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Wizard</li></ul><p>You banish the nonmagical dirt or clay in a 5-foot cube you can see, and harden the edges to prevent cave-ins.  While the spell persists, you can use your action to banish another cube within range.</p><p>This spell can also target earth elementals, and forces them to make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failure, they take 4d6 force damage, or half as much on a success.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When cast as a 4th level spell or higher, this spell can also dig through unworked nonmagical stone.  When cast as an 8th or 9th level spell, this spell can banish all nonmagical nonliving substances short of adamantine.</p><h2>Endless Sword</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: Special</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (10-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: M (a melee weapon that deals slashing damage)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 round</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>On your turn, you can cast this spell, no action required. When you do so, your blade absorbs echoes of the destruction it wreaks until the end of your current turn. On your next turn, you can use your action to release this energy, summoning a storm of ephemeral razors. If you do not release the energy, it fades away, and the spell ends.</p><p>When you release the energy, creatures other than you within 10 feet of you must succeed on a constitution saving throw or take slashing damage equal to half the amount of slashing damage you dealt with the material component for this spell since you cast the spell. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage. After releasing the energy, the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level higher than 2nd this spell is cast at, you can increase the radius by 10 feet.</p><h2>Endurance</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: S, M (a bit of wet clay)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric, Druid, Warlock</li></ul><p>You touch a creature and shroud it in reinforcing magic.

If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw to resist.</p><ul><li><strong>Enlarge</strong>: The target's size increases by one class, and its weight octuples.  If there isn't enough room for this growth, the target attains the maximum size possible for the available space.  Until the spell ends, the target has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  Additionally, the target's weapons grow to match its new size.  When the creature makes a weapon attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage.</li><li><strong>Reduce</strong>: The target's size decreases by one class, and its weight shrinks to one-eighth of normal.  Until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  Additionally, the target's weapons shrink to match its new size.  When the creature makes a weapon attack, it deals 1d4 less damage.</li></ul><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For every two spell levels above 2nd this is cast at, the creature's size class increases or decreases by one additional tier, altering its weight appropriately and adding or removing another d4 of damage.</p><h2>Flame Blade</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Bonus Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a leaf of sumac)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Sorcerer</li></ul><p>You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.</p><p>You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 fire damage plus your Wisdom modifier.</p><p>The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.</p><h2>Fling</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Psion, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You manipulate gravity around one large or smaller creature.

If you fling them any other direction, they take 2d6 damage and fall prone.

A creature that navigates the area by sight finds its path bending and twisting before it.  Any ranged attack passing through, into, or out of the cube is made with disadvantage.  Whenever a creature moves to exit the cube, roll a d4 to determine which side they actually emerge from (1 = North, 2 = East, 3 = South, 4 = West).  If the creature flies, use a d6 instead to account for vertical movement (5 = Down, 6 = Up).  If the face rolled is blocked by an obstacle, the creature moves to that boundary and comes to a stop instead.</p><h2>Gravity Surge</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (20-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Warlock, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You create a crushing field of gravity in a 15-foot radius sphere. Any creature within the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature falls prone and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. On a success, a creature takes no damage and is not knocked prone. Creatures that are not on the ground make this saving throw with disadvantage.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels:</strong> When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d6 for each spell level above 2nd.</p><h2>Harvest</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (10-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid</li></ul><p>You cause nearby plants with edible components to grow rapidly, instantly producing full-size ripe produce.

The target creature receives 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be launched 10 feet away in a direction of your choice.  The creature does not take fall damage unless it would fall further, such as if it is launched off a cliff.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level above 2nd this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance increases by 10 feet.</p><h2>Magic Weapon</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Bonus Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Artificer, Paladin, Wizard</li></ul><p>You touch a nonmagical weapon.

It must make a Dexterity saving throw or become bound by the spell as it encircles its neck.  For the duration, you and the target cannot move farther apart.  If you move closer together, the chain retracts into your hand.  If one of you attempts to move farther away, you must make a contested Strength (athletics) check.  If the mover is victorious, they succeed in dragging the other party.</p><p>The chain can pass through solid objects, but wraps around the corners of barriers of magical force.</p><h2>Parasitic Melody</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Enchantment</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard</li></ul><p>You sing an annoying jingle that becomes stuck in the head of a target creature that can hear you.  For the duration, when the creature makes concentration checks with disadvantage.  Additionally, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw or take 2d6 Psychic damage.  Once the creature has lost concentration on a spell, this spell ends.</p><h2>Phantasmal Force</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p><p>The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.</p><p>The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.</p><p>While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall—it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p><p>An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

As the figment changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the figment.

Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts a solid surface, it explodes.  Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw.

Each meteor is its own instance of damage.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For every spell level above 3rd that this spell is cast at, one more meteor is generated.

The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early.  The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.  If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger enters the target’s dreams.</p><p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target.  If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than 10 words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save, the echoes of the monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents it from gaining any benefit from that rest.  Additionally, when it wakes, it receives 3d6 Psychic damage.</p><p>If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping of a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes the saving throw for this spell with disadvantage.</p><h2>Force Blast</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 300 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a hammer)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You hurl a concussive burst of force at a target uncontrolled object or creature you can see within range.

Select a target creature within range.  If the creature is within 30 feet of the ground, roots erupt from the earth beneath them and attempt to ensnare the target.  If the creature is airborne, they pull it to the ground.  The creature must then make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the roots.  If the creature succeeds, it is not restrained, and the spell ends.

Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.</p><p>If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><h3>Transmute Mud to Rock</h3><p>Nonmagical mud or quicksand in a 40-foot cube no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points but otherwise possesses the standard properties of stone.</p><h3>Flowstone</h3><p>You cause nonmagical rock in a 40-foot cube to flow like thick syrup, allowing it to move around objects, be directed into a mold, etc.  One minute after casting, the stone slowly hardens, giving creatures the ability to escape it.</p><h3>Transmute Rock to Lava</h3><p>Nonmagical rock or mud in a 5-foot cube is transformed into molten lava.  A creature that begins its turn in the lava's area or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 8d6 fire damage, half on success.  The lava cools after 2d6 hours.</p><h3>Transmute Stone to Sand</h3><p>Nonmagical rock of any type in a 40-foot cube is transmuted to an equivalent volume of sand.  The sand is difficult terrain.</p><h3>Transmute Sand to Glass</h3><p>Nonmagical sand or quicksand that fits within a 40-foot cube and is no more than 10-feet deep is transmuted to clear, polished glass.  Creatures within the volume must make a Dexterity saving throw to be safely shunted to the surface in the nearest unoccupied space.  On a failure, the creature is restrained inside the glass.  A restrained creature may use its action to make a DC20 Strength check with advantage to break the glass.  The glass has AC 12 and 5 hit points and the standard properties of glass.  </p><p>When the glass is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, dealing 8d6 slashing damage to any creatures or objects that were trapped within it.</p><h3>Transmute Sand to Stone</h3><p>You transmute an area of sand no more than 10 feet deep in a 40-foot cube into sandstone.   Creatures within the volume must make a Dexterity saving throw to be safely shunted to the surface in the nearest unoccupied space.  On a failure, the creature is restrained inside the sandstone.

You create undulating figments around them that makes the world seem to twist and bend.  Each target has its speed reduced by 5 until the end of the spell.  Additionally, the targets must make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failure, a creature is sickened.  A creature sickened by this spell falls prone at the beginning of each of its turns and may not take reactions.  A sickened creature repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the sickness on itself on a success.  Ending the sickness does not remove the speed reduction.</p><p>Sailors have advantage on saving throws imposed by this spell.</p><p>A creature may close its eyes at the beginning of its turn to be treated as blinded until the beginning of its next turn.

The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone.

This includes changes such as attractiveness, skin or fur coloration, hair curliness, or the ability to glow faintly in the dark without casting useful light.  You may not add or remove appendages, horns, hair, or similar extrusions with this option.  This change always succeeds.</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: You may increase or decrease the fetus's destined size class by one tier.  If increasing, upon giving birth, the mother must make a DC18 Constitution saving throw or receive slashing damage equal to twice the newborn's maximum hit points.  On a success, she receives half as much.</li><li><strong>Flavor Trait</strong>: You may add or remove one trait from the fetus, provided that this change does not have the potential to increase its CR.  These can include changes such as adding a prehensile tail, changing alignment, changing diet, increasing speed by 10 feet, or changing a water breathing species to be air breathing or amphibious.  You have advantage on checks made to make this type of change.</li><li><strong>Power Trait</strong>: You may add or remove a trait that has the potential to increase the creature's challenge rating.  See DMG 280 for details.  The DM has wide latitude to interpret the emergent challenge rating due to multiple traits interacting.  For certain changes, the amount that can be added in one casting of this spell is limited.  The following should be considered guidelines for other player-desired changes.</li><ul><li><strong>AC</strong>: +1</li><li><strong>Add Melee Attack</strong>: adding an initial attack will deal 1d4+strength mod.</li><li><strong>Add Ranged Attack</strong>: adding an initial ranged attack will deal 1d4+dexterity mod.</li><li><strong>Add Breath Weapon</strong>: may be any element, deals 2d6 on a failed Dexterity save against a Charisma-based DC, half on success.</li><li><strong>Upgrade Attack</strong>: increase an attack's number of damage dice by 1 or increase damage die size by one.  Damage die size cannot exceed hit die size.</li><li><strong>Add Extra Attack</strong>: Allows a creature to make an extra attack per round.  A creature can have no more attacks per round than its speed divided by 6.</li><li><strong>Increase Ability Score</strong>: increase an ability score by 2, increase two ability scores by one, or grant a feat.  A creature's ability score cannot be upgraded beyond your spellcasting level plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</li><li><strong>Add Hit Dice</strong>: increase the number of hit dice by two.</li><li><strong>Add Proficiency</strong>: add two skill proficiencies, three weapon proficiencies (provided it has reasonable means to use them), one armor proficiency (working up from light), or one saving throw proficiency.  You may not grant a creature proficiency in a skill unless it has a score of 8 or higher in the base ability score.</li><li><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: on the first use of this option, the creature starts life with a cantrip and a once-a-day 1st level spell.  Thereafter, through castings of this spell, you may add a new spell of a level it can cast and increase the spells of that level per day by 1, add two cantrips, add two spells of levels it can cast, or increase maximum spell level and allow one use of the new level per day.  A creature cannot have more spell usages a day of a given level than it has of the levels below it.</li></ul></ul><p>Upon the birth or hatching of the offspring, make a spellcasting ability modifier check (unless stipulated otherwise above).

If the mother would have had to make a saving throw due to a size increase, she no longer does.</li><li>On a failure greater than 10, the creature is stillborn and cannot be resurrected by any means.</li></ul><p>If you needed to make this check and the spell takes hold, the creature is considered a monstrosity, in addition to whatever class its parents are.</p><p>You may cast this more than once on a given fetus, but each successive casting increases the DC by 2.</p><h2>Dragon's Sight</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Divination</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action Ritual</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 1000 miles</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a table covered in sand mixed with finely ground diamonds worth 1000gp)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 8 hours</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Wizard</li></ul><p>When you cast this spell, you name a settlement or geographical feature within range.  The sand on the table then reshapes itself into the topography and structures in a radius up to 10 miles around the center of the specified location.  The spell grants sufficient detail to make out the presence or absence of major features, large buildings, blocks of smaller buildings, or large troop formations, but is incapable of finer detail.  The map updates in real time.</p><p>If a spell of 5th level or higher is cast within the target area and the origin of the spell is not behind 1 foot of material or a thin sheet of metal, a flash of color for the school of magic, per the <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/01.md#detect-magic\">Detect Magic</a> spell, will appear in the corresponding location on the sand table.</p><h2>Flash Flood</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 600 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a water reed)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Wizard</li></ul><p>You summon torrential rains from the sky to inundate a 150-foot radius column centered on a point you can see within range. Nonmagical flames in the column are extinguished and vapor clouds such as @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.hOkV8XsBlEshI36K]{Fog Cloud} or <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/05.md#cloudkill\">Cloudkill</a> are harmlessly dispersed. Magma within the radius solidifies and the surface of the ground becomes flooded in 6 feet of water, compelling Large or smaller creatures to swim.  When a Huge or larger walking creature or a flying creature without the Hover feature either enters the column or begins its turn there, it is immediately soaked and must make a Strength saving throw.  On a failure, walking creatures fall prone and flying creatures drop 40 feet.</p><p>After the spell ends, such as through <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/03.md#dispel-magic\">Dispel Magic</a>, duration expiration, or broken concentration, the area is rendered difficult terrain by the leftover muck.</p><p>This spell fails if the target point does not have a clear view of the sky.</p><h2>Harm</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Necromancy</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric</li></ul><p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a curse allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each level higher, damage increases by 3d6.</p><h2>Isabelle's Entailment</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric</li></ul><p>You can only cast this spell at the beginning of your turn.  Select a humanoid you can see within range.  The target creature can use its reaction to immediately take an additional turn.  This turn does not restore the creature’s reaction.

One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw.  The target automatically succeeds if it is immune to being charmed.  On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends.</p><p>On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 Psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target appear dangerous to it in some way.  You might cause it to hallucinate that it is surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws of teeth.  Whatever form the hallucination takes, the target can’t see or hear anything beyond it and it is restrained for the duration.  If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, it takes 10d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends.</p><h2>Nightmare</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a decapitated stuffed animal)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You flood the target's mind with momentary vivid hallucinations of its own gruesome, gloryless death, dealing 30d4 Psychic damage to the target from the psychological trauma of it.  A creature that is not unconscious before damage is applied may attempt an Intelligence saving throw to see the illusion for what it is, taking only half damage on success.  If this spell does not reduce the target to zero hit points, the hallucinations fade, and the target's mind begins to return to normal.  At the end of each of its next two turns, it heals back one fourth of the damage taken after resistances and immunities.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each level higher, damage increases by 5d4.</p><h2>Programmed Illusion</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25gp)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Wizard</li></ul><p>You create an audiovisual figment that activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the figment behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.</p><p>When the condition you specify occurs, the figment springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the figment finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the figment can be activated again.</p><p>The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create a figment of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the figment to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.</p><h2>Psychic Wind</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Enchantment</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer</li></ul><p>You call down a tremendous blast of psychic energy on a point on the ground that you can see within range.  Creatures within a cylinder originating at that point that is 20 feet in radius and 120 feet in height must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be overwhelmed with psychic energy.  On a failure, a creature receives 13d6 psychic damage.</p><p>Creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this spell are slain, but psychic echoes remain as faint figments of the creatures in their last moments.  Within the first minute of a creature's death by this spell, a creature can spend an action while within 5 feet of a psychic echo to absorb the psychic echo.  The creature gains one of the following benefits of its choice:</p><ul><li>Select one of the deceased's known or prepared spells.  Until the end of your next long rest, that spell is known to you, and you can cast it, provided you have spell slots of the appropriate level.  If you can transcribe spells into a spellbook, you can transcribe the spell during this time, as if from another spellbook.  </li><li>You regain mana points up to the challenge rating (or level) of the slain creature or the level of this spell, whichever is lower.</li></ul><p>Once a creature absorbs a psychic echo, it cannot do so again until it completes a long rest.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level above 2nd this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d6.</p><h2>Raogon's Hierarchy</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Abjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a piece of tempered glass)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 8 hours</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>Whenever you are subjected to a level 1 spell or a grade 1 cantrip, you can elect to have the attack miss if it is not a critical hit and to automatically succeed on any saving throws against such spells.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When cast at 7th level, the effects extend to spells cast with a second level slot.  At 8th, effects apply to third level slots.  At 9th, when you cast a spell, you can elect to disregard protective magic from 1st level spells and grade 1 cantrips.</p><h2>Sunbeam</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (60-foot line)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>A brilliant beam of light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-line.  Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn.  On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not blinded.  Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p><p>For the duration, a mote of radiant sunlight shines in your hand, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for 30 feet beyond that. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to create a new line of radiance.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level above 6th this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d8.</p><h2>Superior Invisibility</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.  Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.  The effects of this spell cannot be penetrated by Infravision.</p><p>Additionally, when you cast this spell, you may designate any number of creatures you can see.  These creatures see a ghostly translucent version of the invisible creature and are therefore able to see it for the purpose of targeting spells or other magical effects.</p><h2>Tenser's Transformation</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a red flag)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 12 hours</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Wizard</li></ul><p>You endow yourself endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic.  Spells of limited time duration that you previously cast on yourself immediately expire.  Until this spell ends, you cannot concentrate on spells, cannot cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Your maximum hit points increase by 50 and your current hit points increase by the same amount.</li><li>You have advantage on all attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</li><li>When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 3d6 Force damage.</li><li>You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.</li><li>You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.</li><li>You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.  You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature that grants you extra attacks such as Extra Attack.</li></ul><p>You may terminate this spell as an action.  If the spell persisted for more than 8 hours, you receive a level of exhaustion when the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level higher this spell is cast at, the maximum hit point bonus is increased by 10 and weapon attacks you make deal an extra 1d6 damage on hit per slot level above 6th.</p><h2>Transport via Plants</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 10 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid</li></ul><p>You target a Large or larger plant within range and open a portal through it to another Large or larger plant on the same plane of existence.

The wall must be contiguous.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p><p>When a panel is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in its space for the spell's duration.

The creature might teleport to the center of the holy site, its entrance, or some other location of significance there at the DM's discretion.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell slot higher than 7th this is cast at, you may teleport an additional creature.</p><h2>Mirage Arcane</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Hour</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Sight</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 10 days</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Druid, Wizard</li></ul><p>As you cast this spell, magic sweeps out from a target position you can see that begins to shroud the surrounding 1 mile square in a powerful glamor.  When you finish casting this spell, the glamor becomes a shadow.  The glamor covers all senses and can even alter the landscape by making one type of terrain resemble another, but the terrain’s general shape must remain the same.  Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow or lake of lava, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.</p><p>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.  The shadow glamor is sufficiently real to deal damage to creatures.  For instance, if a creature fell into a shadow lava pool created by this spell, it would take the normal damage for falling into lava (18d10 fire damage for being submerged in lava, per DMG249).</p><p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.</p><p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form. However, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature still physically interacts with the illusion.</p><p>The illusion can be dispelled from anywhere within its area.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: If you cast this spell with an 8th level spell slot, the casting time drops to 1 minute.  If you cast this spell with a 9th level spell slot, its casting time becomes 1 action.</p><h2>Mordenkainen's Sword</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword worth 250gp)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 10 minutes</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Wizard</li></ul><p>You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range for the duration.  When the sword appears, make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword.  On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage.  Until the spell ends, you can use your bonus action to move the sword up to 30 feet and then make another spell attack.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level above 7th this is cast at, the spell deals an additional 1d10 damage.</p><h2>Project Image</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 500 miles</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a small replica of you worth at least 5gp)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 day</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Wizard</li></ul><p>You create an audiovisual figment of yourself that lasts for the duration.</p><p>The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The figment looks and sounds like you, and if the figment takes any damage, it disappears, you receive 3d6 Psychic damage, and the spell ends.</p><p>You can use your action to move this figment up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.</p><p>You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.</p><p>For the duration, while you are using the figment's senses, you can cast illusion spells through it, but the process is taxing, requiring you to expend a spell slot of one level higher than would ordinarily be required for the spell.</p><h2>Sacred Name</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Abjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Minute</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (1-mile radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 day</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>When you cast this spell, you utter a proper noun, which serves as the verbal component of the spell, and charge it with power.  For the spell’s duration, whenever a creature within range speaks the word aloud, you become aware of its utterance if you are not incapacitated, as well as the speaker’s precise current location.  As a reaction, you can choose to deal 2d6 damage to the speaker.  If you are good-aligned, the damage is radiant.  If you are neutral, it is psychic.  If you are evil, it is necrotic.  The creature then loses the ability to speak until the beginning of its next turn.</p><p>This effect also triggers if a creature within range casts a spell that targets you by name, such as Psychic Lance, Sending, Wish, Dream, or Scrying.  If you use your reaction to deal damage to the speaker, the triggering spell is lost and any resources are expended.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: If you cast this spell with an 8th level slot, the radius increases to 500 miles.  If you cast the spell with a 9th level slot, it affects the entire plane of existence you are on.  If you cast this spell with a 10th level slot, it affects the entire multiverse.</p><h2>Simulacrum</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 12 Hours</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to make a life-sized copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Wizard</li></ul><p>You shape the ice or snow and then apply a shadow glamor to it, transforming it into a duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell.</p><p>The duplicate is a creature, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.</p><p>The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.</p><p>If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.</p><p>If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.</p><h2>Sunder</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (300-foot cone)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a shard of glass)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You launch a devastating percussive wave from your palm.  For a 300-foot cone in front of you, all creatures must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 8d6 Thunder damage, or half as much on a success.  This damage ignores resistance, and constructs have disadvantage on the saving throw.  Structures in the area automatically take maximized damage on each 10-foot cube exposed to the caster's line of sight.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: For each spell level above 7th this is cast at, the damage increases by 2d6.</p>"}

Non-magical plants in the area that aren't creatures wither and die instantly.</p><p>Additionally, a creature that fails its save finds it difficult to function and think due to dehydration.  Such a creature is subjected to the effects of the Poisoned status.

Additionally, at the end of the target’s first turn each round, it immediately takes another turn, but on its second turn, it cannot cast a leveled spell if it did so on its first turn.  Also, if the creature takes the <em>Use an Object</em> action on its first turn, it cannot take the same action with the same object on its second turn.</p><h2>Aura of Invisibility</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (20-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>Up to 6 willing creatures that you can see within range turn invisible.

Each boulder has a radius of 10 feet and leaves a hole with the same radius.  When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can command the boulders to roll directly toward points of your choice within 150 feet of you.  The boulders can climb sheer cliffs and can jump over gaps up to 50 feet wide, but they cannot end their movement on unsupported spaces.</p><p>A creature or object in the path of a rolling boulder must make a Strength saving throw or be crushed by its passage, receiving 5d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone.  A creature that succeeds receives half damage as it is shunted to the side.</p><p>If a boulder ends its movement atop a creature, the creature is restrained.  As an action, the creature may make an Strength (athletics) check against your spell save DC to attempt to free itself.  If it succeeds, it is safely shunted to the side but remains prone.</p><p>A creature atop a boulder may attempt to ride it as it moves by making a DC 15 Dexterity (acrobatics) check.  You automatically succeed on this check.  A creature that fails the check falls into the path of the boulder as it moves.  Creatures standing where the boulders emerge begin atop them.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When this spell is cast with a 9th level slot, a 4th boulder is summoned.</p><h2>Chronicle</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (1-mile radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a flip-book animation of a king doing something and a diamond worth at least 8000gp)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 24 hours</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard</li></ul><p>You magically transcribe all that occurs around you in the material component gemstone such that anyone who shines a magical light through the gemstone will be presented with a life-size illusion that replays all that happened around you over the spell's duration.

The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.</p><p>For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p><p>Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell at 9th level, the damage increases by 1d10.</p><h2>Eruption</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 500 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian and ground pumice)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>The earth bucks upward at a target point on the ground that you can see within range as magma builds below and bursts upward in a pillar of molten rock.  Creatures within a cylinder 100 feet high with a 15-foot radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 10d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success.  After the initial eruption, the lava spreads out into a shallow pool with a 30 foot radius.  If on a steep incline, the pool of lava flows downhill at 5 feet per round at the beginning of each of your turns.</p><p>Movement through the lava pool is extremely difficult.  Every five feet of movement through the lava consumes 10 additional feet of movement and deals 1d6 points of fire damage.</p><p>A creature that begins its turn within the pool or moves into the pool for the first time on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 4d6 fire damage, half on success.</p><p>After one minute, the lava hardens to rock.  Creatures within the lava at the time become restrained.  A creature can use an action to try to free a restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check to pull the creature free or by dealing damage to it. The rock around a creature’s feet has an AC of 15 and 25 hit points.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: If this spell is cast with a 9th level slot, every five feet of movement through the lava pool deals an additional 1d6 damage.</p><h2>Eternal Rest</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Necromancy</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric</li></ul><p>You fire a searing beam of golden light at one creature within range.  If the creature is an undead of CR 8 or lower, it is annihilated in a flash of light, leaving no trace.  Otherwise, make a ranged spell attack, dealing 10d12 Radiant damage on a hit.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: If you cast this spell with a 9th level slot, the spell deals an additional 2d12 damage, and it can automatically destroy undead of CR 9 or below.</p><h2>Fissure</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 300 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Wizard</li></ul><p>Select a point you can see within range.  You cause an area of natural terrain 30 feet wide and 150 feet long to detonate, throwing debris into the air.  The area is centered on the point and may be in any orientation you choose.  Creatures on or above the affected terrain that are 30 feet or less off the ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 12d10 bludgeoning damage, half on success.</p><p>The area of the spell becomes difficult terrain until cleared.  Each 5-foot square requires 1 minute to clear by hand.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: If you cast this spell with a 9th level slot, the spell deals an additional 1d10 damage, and the fissure extends for another 50 feet.</p><h2>Greater Telekinesis</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You gain the ability to move creatures and objects by thought.  For the duration, you have a fly (hover) speed of 30 feet.  As an action while the spell persists, you can perform one of the abilities below, targeting a huge or smaller creature or object within range.  On following turns, you can change targets and abilities.</p><p>If it is an unwilling creature or controlled object, the creature can make a strength check contested by a spellcasting ability check to resist the effect.  If you win the contest and the target is a creature, you may choose to restrain the target until the end of your next turn.</p><h3>Telekinetic Abilities</h3><ul><li><strong>Move</strong>: You move a creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward.</li><li><strong>Crush</strong>: You painfully squeeze the target, dealing 6d10 bludgeoning damage.  If the target is a creature, you can strangle it, forcing it to hold its breath until the end of your next turn.  If during this time, the creature attempts to speak or cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or fail to get the words out.  If it was attempting to cast a spell, no materials or spell slot resources are wasted.</li><li><strong>Manipulate</strong>: You have excellent fine motor control with this spell.  If you would make a tool check that would require Dexterity or Strength, you may use your spellcasting ability modifier instead, and you make the check with advantage.</li><li><strong>Launch</strong>: Select up to three objects weighing no more than 10 pounds each that are within range.  Each object then flies up to 150 feet in directions of your choice before falling to the ground.  If a projectile impacts a creature or object early, both the projectile and what it impacted receive 3d10 damage of a type appropriate for the projectile.  A creature in a projectile’s path may make a dexterity saving throw to avoid it.</li></ul><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell at 9th level, you can use two abilities as part of the same action.  Alternatively, you can use the same ability twice.  When cast at 10th level, the abilities of this spell only require your bonus action.</p><h2>Hijack</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Abjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Reaction, which you take when you observe a creature casting a spell within range.</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 90 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>If the triggering spell is cast at 7th level or lower, you seize control of the nascent magic, learn its nature, and may retarget its casting as if you had cast it yourself.  You do not require any components for the hijacked spell.  If the spell requires Concentration, you must maintain it.  The hijacked spell uses your spellcasting ability modifier and spell save DC.</p><h2>Illusory Dragon</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Wizard</li></ul><p>You create a Huge shadow figment of a dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell’s duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.</p><p>When the figment appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the figment up to 80 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The figment is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically. it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell at 9th level, the damage increases by 2d6.</p><h2>Incendiary Cloud</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range.  The cloud spreads around corners and heavily obscures its contents.  Its area is considered difficult terrain, and uncontrolled flammable items instantly ignite within it.</p><p>When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw.  A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there.</p><p>At the beginning of each of your turns, you can move the cloud up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell at 9th level, the damage increases by 1d8.</p><h2>Maddening Darkness</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 150 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, M (a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 10 minutes</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.</p><p>Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When you cast this spell at 9th level, the damage increases by 1d8.</p><h2>Prominence Orb</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (60-foot line)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>A coruscating orb of energy crackles into being in your palm, and you hurl it in a direction of your choice.  The orb passes through creatures, but bounces off solid surfaces as well as @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.TIfOzkWkUYCZexaQ]{Wall of Force} and similar magic.</p><p>After traveling 10 feet away from you, the orb stabilizes, and a jagged bolt of energy arcs off it toward each creature that it comes within 10 feet of as it travels. Each of these creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 11d4+30 force damage.  Once the orb has traveled 60 feet, it fizzles into nothingness.  If the orb passes the same creature multiple times, energy only arcs toward it the first time.</p><p>Creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this spell, as well as nonmagical objects they control, are obliterated, exploding into a flash of light that leaves no trace, save for a small scorch mark on the ground.

If you lose concentration, the star remains, but you lose the capacity to delay its activation further.</p><p>At the completion of your first turn on which you do not defer the spell, a brilliant pillar of arcane energy screams down upon the target point in a pillar with a 20-foot radius.  Nonmagical structures in the way are obliterated, and everything else within the pillar receives 2d100 force damage plus 1d100 for each time you deferred the spell's activation.  @Compendium[owlmarble-magic.spells.TIfOzkWkUYCZexaQ]{Wall of Force} and similar magic is dispelled if the pillar passes through it.  Creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this spell are annihilated, as is their soul.  Magical items of quality Rare and below that are within the pillar are also annihilated.</p><p>This spell's destructive power burrows into the ground, creating a deep, narrow crater.  Every 20 points of damage allows digging through 5 feet of dirt.  Stone requires 50 points per five feet. Metal requires 70 points per five feet.  This spell boils away water without consuming burrowing distance.  Damage dealt to anything above the target point does not consume burrowing distance.</p><p>This spell cannot target a location on a plane that does not extend at least 10 miles above the ground, but it can target spaces inside structures. In such cases, the bolt streaks up through the roof, igniting flammable material along the way.  If you target a point underground with this spell, the spell will instead target the surface above your desired target.</p><p>Afterward, plants cannot grow within 100 feet of the crater for the next 2d20 decades.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: Initial damage increases by 1d100 when you cast this spell with a 10th level slot.</p><h2>Azdregath's Chemical Catastrophe</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 300 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a handful of salt)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You transmute a nonmagical stone object of size Huge or smaller or up to a 15-foot cube of a larger object into a boiling incandescent puddle of purple ectoplasmic goo. Indigo flames dance on its surface and shed bright light for 10 feet and dim light for 10 feet beyond that.  Every foot of movement through the goo requires three feet of movement.</p><p>The area covered by goo varies with the size of the original object and spreads out equally in all directions.  Small and Tiny objects yield a 5-foot radius.  Medium objects result in a 10-foot radius.  Large objects yield a 20-foot radius.  Huge objects yield a 40-foot radius.</p><p>Creatures that begin their turn in the goo or enter it for the first time on their turns receive 7d6 fire damage, 7d6 poison damage, and 7d6 acid damage and are Poisoned until they leave the area.  The damage dealt by this spell ignores resistances.  At the start of each of your turns, the goo eats 5 feet down through any nonmagical dirt, sand, stone, metal, plant matter, or other non-living material it sits upon.  The goo sinks in water, but continues to burn and cannot be quenched by any means, including <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish\">Wish</a>.</p><p>When the spell ends by any means, even if by antimagic, the goo retracts backward and reverts to the original object, pulling any creatures in the area with it.  Creatures in the goo that are smaller than the original object must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be petrified inside the original object, their faces rising out of the material in whatever expression they last held, possibly with arms or hands outstretched.  To restore a creature petrified by this spell, its face must be subjected to anti-petrification magic, and then it must be broken out by destroying the object around the creature.</p><h2>Blade of Disaster</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Bonus Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You create a blade-shaped rift in reality in an unoccupied space you can see within range.

A number up to 100 times your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 100) of willing creatures or objects no larger than Gargantuan that you can see within range turn invisible for the spell’s duration, and Wisdom (survival) checks made to gather information about the cloaked legion are made with disadvantage.  Anything an affected creature wears or carries is also invisible as long as it is on the creature’s person.

Each round such a creature spends within this radius, it must make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of its turn or permanently loses HP equal to the size of its hit dice.

The creature loses all memory of its former self, and you can choose to remove any or all of the creature’s proficiencies and class features, if it has any.  You can also reduce any of the creature’s mental scores of your choice, to a minimum of 8.</p><p>You decide the new identity’s past and personality, creating memories, beliefs, and desires as you choose, but you cannot change the creature’s alignment.  The creature’s mind fills in any gaps in its story and rationalizes any inconsistencies.  If a creature’s alignment conflicts with its new identity, it justifies it as best it can and dismisses it as a sense of unease or discomfort.</p><p>You can also weave the shadow glamor into a new appearance.

The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 40 feet in diameter. You can orient the portals in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.</p><p>The portals have a front and a back on each plane where they appear. The front looks to be a rippling pool and the back looks to be made of gold. Travel through the portals is possible only by moving through their fronts. Anything, including spell effects (such as the pillar of Arcane Annihilation) that does so is instantly transported to the other portal, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.</p><p>Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal.

The creature is cursed in those ways for one minute.  Alternatively, you may apply a single curse permanently.</li><li><strong>Excommunicate</strong>: If the creature worships the same deity you do and has at least one, but fewer levels in Paladin, Cleric, and/or Warlock associated with it, it is stripped of all class features from those levels, but retains ability score increases, feats, and health.  If the target can strike a deal with a new patron or god within a month, the target loses two of the inactive levels, but the rest are transferred to the new patron.</li><li><strong>Mercy</strong>: You restore 70 hit points to the target. Any excess healing becomes temporary hit points that last until the end of the creature's next short or long rest.</li><li><strong>Penance</strong>: You set an objective for a creature and curse it to fulfill it.  If the creature does not fulfill the objective within one year, it is Vanquished, as if by this spell or has one of the effects of <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/03.md#bestow-curse\">Bestow Curse</a> permanently applied to it, the very fabric of its being changing to make this effect removable only through direct divine action or through <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish\">Wish</a>.</li><li><strong>Vanquish</strong>: a pillar of energy streams down from the sky onto the creature, compelling a Constitution saving throw.

While a panel is destroyed, creatures, objects, and spell effects may pass through the hole, but translocation cannot.  If 400 or more triangles are destroyed at any given time, the shield breaks, and the spell ends.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: When cast at 10th level, the triangles become immune to nonmagical weapons, magic of first level, and first grade cantrips.

You craft a shadow figment of every willing creature within 50 feet of each point.  These figments take their turns immediately after yours and follow your mental commands (no action required by you) as long as you are on the same plane of existence.  They have all the ability scores and traits of the original creatures, but cannot deal damage or impose status effects on other creatures, although they still count as hostile creatures for features such as Sneak Attack and Flanking until they have been revealed as illusions.  Each figment has half the hit points of the original creature.  The figments are indistinguishable from the original creatures until they make an effort to deal damage or receive melee damage themselves.</p><p>The figments created by this spell are not detectable as such by spells such as Detect Magic, though Truesight will still reveal their nature.</p><h2>Power Word Kill</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Necromancy</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 60 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You attempt to sever a target creature's link between body and soul.

If you later speak the words in the presence of the primary diamond, the effects of this spell activate or deactivate respectively.  While active, teleportation or portals within fifty miles of any diamond used as a material component for this spell is impossible and such spells that are attempted immediately fail during casting.  Use of magesight while the effect is active reveals waves of abjuration magic radiating in great waves from the lesser gems and massive, but discrete packets of abjuration magic heading toward the lesser gems from the primary diamond.</p><p>To dispel the effect, the central diamond must be targeted with antimagic or shattered.  Placing a lesser gem in an antimagic field causes it to have its normal effects outside the field.

You must then cast the spell while sitting on the seating component throughout the entire casting.</p><p>Upon completion, all inanimate material within the radius breaks free of material outside the radius.  Within a spherical volume with the original diamond dust radius, gravity points toward the nearest side of the plane on which the diamond dust was scattered, translated for its current location and orientation.</p><p>While sitting in the chair, you can change the orientation of the skycastle (up to 11.25 degrees per round) and fly it up to 100 feet per round.  Objects within the gravitational radius do not feel these shifts.  The skycastle may not fly more than 1 mile above the surface of Faerun (i.e. 1 mile above sea level if over the ocean or 5 miles above sea level if flying over a mountain with a peak of 4 miles above sea level).</p><p>As a bonus action while touching the throne, you may stipulate the creature presently sitting on the throne as an alternate pilot.</p><p>To dispel this effect, the throne itself must be subjected to sufficiently powerful antimagic.  If the dispel is successful, the castle safely descends at a rate of 100 feet per round for one minute with its gravity field intact.  If it has not landed in that time, it plummets the rest of the way at 500 feet per round.  Creatures and objects beneath the castle when it plummets in this way receive 20d20 bludgeoning damage for every 100 feet it falls.</p><h2>Sonic Boom</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (1000-foot cone)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You lurch forward in a direction of your choice and immediately travel up to 1000 feet to a point you can see.  This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and does not trigger readied actions targeting you, but any hazards between you and your destination otherwise apply as normal.  If you collide with an invisible solid object in your path such as a Wall of Force, you die, and your body is destroyed, rendered into fine paste.</p><p>From your destination point, you create a tremendous shockwave of energy that propagates backwards toward your starting point as a cone with a length equal to the distance traveled, dealing 20d6 thunder damage to creatures and uncontrolled objects within it.  A creature may attempt a Constitution saving throw to take half damage instead.  Success or failure, creatures within the cone are deafened.</p><p>This spell deals double damage to structures.</p><h2>Time Stop</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>When you cast this spell, you can choose to alter the flow of time in one of two ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Full Stop</strong>: You halt the flow of time for all creatures other than yourself.  This effect ends early if you or any effects you create during this period affect a creature other than you or an object that is controlled by someone other than you.</li><li><strong>Matter Stop</strong>: You halt the flow of time for all physical matter, but you exempt the minds of all creatures within 1 mile of you.  During this time, all affected creatures gain a telepathy range of 2 miles and can communicate freely.  As the caster, you have the ability to broadcast a message to any or all of the affected creatures simultaneously.</li></ul><h2>Transform Terrain</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Minute</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (200-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid</li></ul><p>You alter the terrain surrounding you into any natural form you desire and can remove or add non-magical plants and beasts while you do so.  This spell cannot be used within 300 feet of a hostile sapient being's structure.  The following are a few examples of what can be done with this spell.</p><ul><li>Make a mountain spring up, covered in trees</li><li>Turn a desert into an oasis</li><li>Level a mountain.</li><li>Raise the ocean floor to create an island</li><li>Form a canyon, filled with lava</li></ul><h2>True Creation</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Permanent</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You create an object worth 5,000gp or less that fits within a 5-foot cube.  Complex objects may require skill checks to successfully create.  Objects created by this spell can be dispelled and cannot be used as spell components.</p><p>If this spell is used to create a magic item, the DM secretly rolls 1d4.  On a 1, the item is cursed.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: At 10th level, the item becomes real and cannot be dispelled and can be used as a spellcasting component.</p><h2>True Polymorph</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 30 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 hour</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. Creatures produced by this spell can be of a novel species, but the DM may ask for a check, with failures potentially leading to uncontrollable monstrosities.</p><p>If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.</p><p>Shapechangers aren't affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.  This spell can't affect a target that has 0 hit points.</p><h3>Creature into Creature</h3><p>If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.</p><p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.</p><p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.</p><p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p><h3>Object into Creature</h3><p>You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.</p><p>If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.</p><h3>Creature into Object</h3><p>If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.  If a spell attempts to use the object as a valuable material component, the spell fails.  The object cannot be of a size class larger than the creature.  If the resulting object is a magic item, it cannot have a rarity above the thresholds defined below and the item inherits the alignment and personality of the creature, can communicate telepathically with a creature in contact with it or attuned to it.</p><ul><li><strong>Common</strong>: any challenge rating.</li><li><strong>Uncommon</strong>: CR1+</li><li><strong>Rare</strong>: CR10+</li><li><strong>Very Rare</strong>: 20+</li><li><strong>Legendary</strong>: 25+</li><li><strong>Divine</strong>: CR30</li></ul><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: At 10th level, when making the effect permanent, the magic reshapes the target's true being into the new form and then the magic of the spell fades, leaving the target permanently in the desired form.  At that point, attempts to dispel the effect are impossible and attempts to detect the magic of this spell on the target fail.  Additionally, the target once more becomes a valid target for this spell.</p><h2>Weird</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You craft an eldritch unknowable symbol on the inside surface of a 30-foot-radius dome centered on a point you can see within range.  Any creature that sees the symbol must make a Constitution saving throw.</p><ul><li><strong>On a success</strong>, the creature receives 4d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends for that creature.  </li><li><strong>On a failure</strong>, the symbol, known as The Weird, penetrates the creature’s mind and the creature must then make a Charisma saving throw as the knowledge begins to tear its identity apart.  A creature can willingly fail this save.</li><ul><li><strong>On a success</strong>, the creature is Paralyzed until the end of its next turn and loses the ability to benefit from short rests or to feel emotions.  It regains these abilities at the end of its next long rest.</li><li><strong>On a failure</strong>, the creature receives Psychic damage equal to its maximum hit points.  If the creature survives this damage, it has a brief flash of insight into the deeper truths of the universe.  Until the end of its next turn, the creature has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and attacks against the creature have disadvantage.</li></ul></ul><p>If this spell reduces a creature to zero hit points, the creature dies.  If the caster wills it, it rises as an <em>Allip</em> π days later unless efforts are taken to cleanse or burn the body beforehand or it is resurrected before then.</p>"}

During this time, they are charmed and friendly toward you and your companions.  You can also issue mental commands to them, no action required.</p><p>At the end of the duration, the plants return to their original forms, and take root wherever they find themselves.</p><h2>Archive</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Reaction, which you take when you witness an event</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Unlimited</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Bard</li></ul><p>As a reaction, you turn an event you witness into an incontrovertible fact of reality.  This could be something such as a natural disaster or a creature's death, decision, birth, ability check, saving throw, or attack roll.  In the event of this spell being cast as a reaction to a die roll, it triggers immediately after the roll’s resolution, but before any abilities that disregard the die roll.  For instance, if a creature fails a saving throw, this spell can interdict the activation of Legendary Resistances or the Lucky feat, forcing the creature to fail.</p><p>Any attempts (even <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish\">Wish</a> and acts of gods) to change history fail if they would prevent an Archived event from occurring.  All creatures who perceive the event cannot have their memories magically altered to forget the event, nor can they forget the event and one minute before and after through any means whatsoever.  Creatures that learn of the event never question its veracity.</p><p>Records of the event mysteriously find their way to safety, and direct attempts to destroy them are fraught with difficulty.  For instance, a book recording an Archived event thrown into a fire might refuse to burn, the throw could go wide, the book might immediately fall back out of the fire, it might be saved by a sudden rainstorm that extinguishes the fire, or an animal might suddenly come along and retrieve the book, depositing it elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, songs about Archived events get stuck in a listener's head, and performance checks to sing them have advantage.</p><h2>Dreamscape</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Illusion</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (300-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a pillow filled with phoenix down)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>You surround yourself with an an intense psychic field.  Creatures within the radius when you cast this spell or that enter the radius later must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or treat your spells as Dream Spells.  A creature may make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns, after all other effects take place.</p><p>Dream Spells have ordinary effects upon creatures that have succeeded on their saves against this spell.  On creatures that have not yet succeeded, however, Dream Spells are perceived as being cast at 9th level and have effects commensurate with that.  If this causes a spell to deal additional damage, the extra damage is dealt as psychic, but the creature perceives it as the normal type of the spell.  Creatures that are subjected to Dream Spells accept any irregularities that result as real, no matter their absurdity.</p><h2>Soul Recall</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Necromancy</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 10 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Cleric</li></ul><p>You speak the name of a creature or touch its remains.  It is restored to life, and any damage to its soul is repaired.  If the creature's soul has been destroyed, you reconstruct it and remove any curses on it.  Once the soul is whole, if the soul is willing, you resurrect the creature.  If you do not have the remains, a new healthy body in the creature's prime will be created for it.</p><p>This spell can also be cast on a living creature who has lost the ability to cast Wish as a means of restoring that faculty.</p><h2>Tharizdun's Oblivion</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (the iris of an Astral Dreadnought)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>This spell deletes a volume of space from reality.  You target a point in space you can see within range and reality collapses inward within a 30-foot radius.  Soulless entities are removed from existence by this spell.  Souled creatures within the radius must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or receive 60d6 Force damage, half on success.</p><p>After this spell is cast, the volume is unoccupiable as it is <em>not</em>.  Creatures may cross instantly from what was once one side of the volume to the other as no distance now exists between them.  Creatures attempting to view an area of reality affected by this spell through use of Truesight will see cracks in reality emanating 30 feet outward from the point where the deleted space used to be.</p><h2>Undead Army</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Necromancy</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Minute</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self (300-foot radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (the skull of a humanoid you personally killed, filled with jewels worth 3000gp, all of which the spell consumes)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</li></ul><p>Corpses of humanoids within the effect radius rise as Zombies, and skeletons of humanoids rise as Skeletons.  The undead created by this spell are under your control indefinitely.  You may mentally order any subset of them as a bonus action.</p><h2>Unmake</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Transmutation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: 120 feet</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (a bone from a miscarried fetus)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>You attempt to unmake a target creature or object by rewinding time.  The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have its age reduced by 1d4 years.  The target loses all memory of the lost time.  If a creature is reduced to an age of zero, it vanishes from existence.  If this event is Archived, that being is irrevocably erased from reality and cannot be restored by any means, even <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#soul-recall\">Soul Recall</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish\">Wish</a>, or <em>Divine Intervention</em>.</p><h2>White Nova</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 2 days</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Touch</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M (powdered gemstones worth 20000gp and a gold sphere worth 10000gp that the spell consumes)</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Wizard</li></ul><p>Over the course of two days in which you cannot rest, you inscribe runes upon the gold sphere used as a material component and fill the engraved runes the provided gemstone dust.  Into those runes you pour unthinkable power, crafting a Nova Sphere.  Once finished, it can only be destroyed by a Sphere of Annihilation or through its own activation.</p><p>Upon this sphere finding itself in the direct path of a fully charged <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/09.md#arcane-annihilation\">Arcane Annihilation</a>, it will devours the pillar of energy, negating the spell's normal effects, whereupon the sphere detonates in a tremendous explosion.</p><h3>Detonation Effects</h3><p>The below effects are cumulative.  Creatures have advantage on the saving throws if they are behind full cover, but cover is otherwise ignored.</p><ul><li>Creatures and objects within 20 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 40d10 Necrotic damage, half on success.</li><li>Creatures and objects within 100 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 40d10 Radiant damage, half on success.</li><li>Creatures and objects within 500 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 40d10 fire damage, half on success.</li><li>Creatures and objects within 1000 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 20d10 Thunder damage, half on success.</li><li>Creatures and objects within 1500 feet must make a Dexterity save or receive 20d10 bludgeoning damage from debris, half on success.</li><li>Creatures and objects large and smaller within 2000 feet must succeed on a Strength save or be knocked prone.</li><li>Creatures within one mile with line of sight to the epicenter or that were within 1000 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw or gain two levels of exhaustion.  Every twelve hours, exhausted creatures must make another Constitution save. On a failure, the creature receives 1d10 Necrotic damage and another level of exhaustion.  After three successes, the creature ceases needing to make this saving throw.</li></ul><h2>Wish</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Conjuration</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Self</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Instantaneous</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast.  By simply speaking aloud, you alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic uses of this spell which do not risk adverse effects in most cases are as follows:</p><ul><li>Duplicate any other spell of 9th level or lower.  No requirements for that spell are needed, including any costly components.  The spell simply takes effect.</li><li>You create a non-magical object of up to 25,000gp in value.  The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.</li><li>You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in Greater Restoration.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type of your choice for one week.</li><li>You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a particular spell for one week.</li><li>You attempt to rewrite history by forcing a reroll of an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that occurred in the last 24 hours.  This reroll is made with either advantage or disadvantage (caster's choice).  If the reroll succeeds where the original failed or vice versa, reality and history reshape themselves to account for the new result so long as it would not alter an Archived event.</li></ul><p>Additional uses of the spell are possible, but are exceptionally dangerous.  The wish may fail, it may be fulfilled in letter but not spirit or an attentive god may intervene, with potentially disastrous results for the caster.  Your DM has wide latitude in interpreting the implementation of the Wish.  If the DM wishes it, Roll a d6.</p><p>1. The spell fails and your hit points are reduced by 10d10 that cannot be resisted or regenerated without Divine Intervention and are unable to cast this spell ever again.</p><p>2. Your spell takes effect as intended, but a great power in the world becomes hostile toward you.</p><p>3. Your spell takes effect in the worst possible way for you.</p><p>4. Your spell takes partial effect and you receive 5d10 Necrotic damage that ignores resistances and cannot be regenerated by any means short of divine intervention for 1 week.</p><p>5. Your spell is fulfilled in letter, but not spirit.</p><p>6. Your spell is fulfilled in spirit.</p><p><strong>Higher Levels</strong>: Should this spell be cast by planar ruler, deity, or if cast using an Orichalcum spellcasting focus, the spell is fulfilled in spirit unless another deity blocks it.  Casting in this way has no adverse effects on the caster.</p><h2>Zenith's Starfall</h2><ul><li><strong>School</strong>: Evocation</li><li><strong>Casting Time</strong>: 1 Action</li><li><strong>Range</strong>: Sight (5-mile radius)</li><li><strong>Components</strong>: V, S, M</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: Concentration, up to 1 minute</li><li><strong>Classes</strong>: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</li></ul><p>The stars rain down from the heavens in a column on an area you choose within range.  All creatures and uncontrolled objects with nothing above them in the affected area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 7d8 Piercing damage and 7d8 Radiant damage.  Wall of Force, Prismatic Wall, and Perimeter Shield protect entities below them and are themselves immune to this damage.  All other barrier spells are bypassed.</p><p>At the start of a creature's turn while in the column or when it first enters it on its turn, it must make another save or receive further damage.</p><p>While concentrating on this spell, you are unable to move or take actions on your turn, and you glow a brilliant blue-white, shedding bright light for 30 feet and dim light for another 30 beyond.</p><p>For 1d4 days after casting this spell, night skies have no stars, and passage through the crystal sphere is impossible.</p>"}
