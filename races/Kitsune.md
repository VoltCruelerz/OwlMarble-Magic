# Kitsune

## Appearance

Kitsune are humanoids that specialize in illusion magic. While physically identical to humans in most respects, Kitsune have two fox-like features: their ears and tails, of which they can have several.

Kitsune tails are an integral part of their magic, with the most egregious crimes in Kitsune society punishable by amputation.

For every odd level above 1st that a Kitsune gains, they grow another tail, to a maximum of 9 at Level 17.
