# Setting

- **Time**: The campaign picks up in year 332 of the Epoch of Cities
    - Campaign 1 ended in 0 EoC
    - Campaign 2 was entirely within 328 EoC
- **Place**: The campaign is based in the city of Sigil, a torus-shaped floating city in the exact center of the Multiverse on a sub-plane of the Prime Material Plane called The Outlands. While in the Outlands.

## Epoch of Cities

After the arrival of the Traveler and the Magequakes that shattered much of civilization, large expanses of the world were flooded and rendered uninhabitable.  To stave off global starvation, Midnight Magic mass produced its food makers. This caused the price of food to crash, and led to a mass exodus of farmers to cities in search of other work.

With no need to manage large swaths of land, eventually, the wilds reclaimed unused farmland. Meanwhile, cities grew larger and more independent, with former nations ultimately shattering into city states.

### Technology Level

In the 300+ years since campaign 1, technology and magic have improved. Portals now connect much of the multiverse, with cities on the same plane often connected by sea and air ships. Recently, Midnight Magic has begun establishing lightning rail routes that allow for high-speed transit between major cities, bypassing tariffs Sigil imposes on portal traffic.

### Geopolitics

With the world so separated, there has been little geopolitical conflict, leading to a record infrequency of wars and military action.

As more portals through Sigil and lightning rail lines on the Prime Material Plane are opened, the world is finally growing smaller again, increasing risk of conflict.

#### Crust Wars & Warforged

In 45 EoC, Drow forces from Menzoberranzan assaulted the fledgling Orzenel Republic. This led to an evacuation of the city.  Through her connections to the surface world, Bray Efriya led an evacuation of allied drow to the surface world where Tazeka Myvalir-Liranov had prepared an area near Cordacet, which would ultimately become New Orzenel.

Centuries later, in 318 EoC, Lolthâ€™s forces again assaulted the surface world, aiming to exterminate the heretics in New Orzenel.  Due to fears of using undead (because of the Fall of Trista), Midnight Magic undertook the task of creating comparable golems to defend the city.

Warforged were the result. When the war ended in 324, the tens of thousands of warforged were ultimately granted personhood by New Orzenel. This was echoed in Cordacet, Sigil, Luethia, and Moltobon, but other cities have been more hesitant. Nonetheless, their precise legal status remains somewhat uncertain. In many jurisdictions, including New Orzenel, they are legally a person who happens to own a golem they cannot be parted from.
