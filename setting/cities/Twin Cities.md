# Twin Cities

Cordacet and New Orzenel are close to one another and share significant infrastructure.

## Cordacet

- **Land Area**: 24 square miles
- **Population**: 780,000
  - 50% human
  - 30% half-elf
  - 20% drow
  - 10% other

A densely-populated oasis city nestled beneath plateaus, it is positioned on a critical trade route between Luethia and Trista.  All lightning rail routes to New Orzenel also pass through Cordacet.

Cordacet is the city of origin for most Changelings, which trace their heritage to Algrug and Trinity Spears.

Cordacet is also one of the few remaining places in the world engaged in agriculture, though it does so with significant magical enhancement, courtesy of two members of its triumvirate.  This food is exported to other cities as a luxury good.

### Triumvirate of Cordacet

Cordacet is ruled by a matriarchal triumvirate composed of an archdruid, an archdryad, and a mortal queen.  At present, Queen Foila Prycan sits on the throne.

- **Queen Foila Prycan**: the present mortal queen, and responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city.
- **Archdryad Arestellia**: in times of peace, she assists Archdruid Liranov with the fields, but she is also the general of the cityâ€™s army.
- **Archdruid Liranov**: she is primarily a magical and agricultural sciences researcher, avoiding the activities of the court whenever possible.  She is also the headmistress of the Fli Koden School of Natural Magic.

## New Orzenel

- **Land Area**: 4 square miles
- **Population**: 250,000
  - 60% drow
  - 20% half elf
  - 10% human
  - 10% other

New Orzenel is shrouded by an eternal illusion to block out the sun for the comfort of its large drow population.  While its population is lower than that of Cordacet, Cordacet is often said to be a suburb of the extremely densely populated New Orzenel.

Due to its small size, large population, and innate connection to Midnight Magic and other enchanting companies, it is the most technologically advanced city in the world, managing the Lightning Rail network to Cordacet and beyond.

New Orzenel is the city of origin for all Warforged.

### Orzenian Council

The ruling body of New Orzenel is the democratically-elected Orzenian Council, serving terms of 60 years, and there are 20 seats on the council (16 drow, 3 half-drow, and 1 human).

Bray Efriya has remained the Speaker of the Council for the entirety of its existence.
