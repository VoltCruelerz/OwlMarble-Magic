The homeland of the slave-collecting fire genies, the City of Brass resides within the Plane of Fire and contains the multiverseâ€™s most expansive magical weapon and slave markets.  It is also home to numerous gladiatorial slave arenas.

The city is ruled by the Efreet Sultan, Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan.
