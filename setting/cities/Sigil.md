The only city in the Outlands (which is otherwise a blasted wasteland as a result of the Traveler), it floats at the top of the top of the Spire.  The city is torus-shaped, with gravity such that the inner surface is the “ground.”  It is also called the City of Doors due to literal thousands of portals in it leading to other planes of existence.  Because there are no physical paths in or out of the city, it is also known as the Cage, and citizens are called Cagers.

Sigil is ruled by the demigoddess Zenith Kyburn, known in this era as the Lady of Magic, or simply “Lady.”  The Lady scarcely interacts with her subjects, preferring to keep to herself and her mysterious plans.  In practice, day-to-day life in Sigil is governed by the Council of Six.

Sigil is predominantly an interplanar trade hub, relying on taxation through its portals.

## Influence of the Outlands

Unlike other places in the multiverse where hostile alignments clash, there is a pacifying effect on the denizens of the Outlands, and therefore Sigil itself.  This allows for businesses run by fiends to be frequented by celestials, for instance.  Furthermore, the Lady forbids cosmic conflicts from interfering within Sigil.

## Council of Six

Seats on the Council are life terms, and when a seat opens, theoretically anyone can run for the seat, but the Lady has attempted to see the city remains balanced.

- **Viesa** (LG): an ancient dragon and archmage, she is the granddaughter of Bahamut and ruled Dar Vangath prior to its fall in 0 EoC.
- **Niv-Mizzet** (CN): an ancient dragon and archmage
- **Isperia** (LN): an ancient sphinx, if not the original sphinx.  She runs the Halls of Concordance, where legal contracts are forged.
- **Zegana** (TN): a merfolk archdruid and pacifist
- **Lady Illmarrow** (NE): an elven lich queen that was ousted from her empire on the Plane of Earth and came to Sigil.  She claims to only eat the souls of unintelligent creatures these days.
- **Councilman Azorious** (??): a recent addition to the Council, Azorious is ostensibly a pacifist who wishes to increase trade with the outside world.

## Law Enforcement

The Dabus, a band of warlocks dedicated to the Lady, fulfill the role of law enforcement within Sigil.  They carry crystalline identification badges, and speak with Her authority.  Dabus agents typically work in pairs, though some work independently.  These agents report to their superiors who in turn report to the Lady, though due to her nature, they avoid involving her unless the threat to Sigil is dire.

Criminals within the city are polymorphed into sheep and sent to a demiplane crafted by the Lady known as the Pasture where they serve out their terms.
