# Aerimor

- **Land Area**: ???
- **Population**: ???

The floating city of Aerimor is now ruled by a council of celestials, and secluded within its own demiplane.  Few have had the fortune of visiting the city, but those exiled from the city for their crimes speak of a near-utopian magical society.

Little is known of it, as those who are expelled are magically compelled to not reveal its secrets.
