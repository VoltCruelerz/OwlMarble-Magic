# Priority Initiative

_Note: this rule is optional for groups that want a more tactical game._

## Round Operation

Each round of combat symbolizes 6 seconds of time.  Turns happen sequentially as a gameplay construct, but theoretically occur simultaneously.  Each round of combat progresses through three phases in order: Initiative, Planning, and Resolution.

### Initiative Phase

At the start of each round, every creature in combat rolls initiative to symbolize their responsiveness in combat for that round.

**Initiative Roll**: `1d20 + dexterity modifier + intelligence modifier`

Sort the list of creatures according to the initiative order.  In the event of a tie, any tied PCs go first in whatever order they wish and then any tied NPCs go in whatever order they wish.

If there are multiple NPCs with the same stat block, roll initiative for them once as a group and have them resolve their turns in whatever order of their choice among themselves.

### Planning Phase

Beginning with the creature with the lowest initiative score and ascending in the order, each creature declares what activities they will perform on their turn.  This allows creatures that are more responsive and quick-witted to act in such a way as to thwart the actions of their opponents.

### Resolution Phase

The creature with the highest initiative roll resolves their planned activities.  You then proceed down the initiative order from highest to lowest.  On each creature’s turn, the creature may execute their planned activities, some or all of which may be replaced or supplemented with Improvised Activities or cancelled entirely.

## Combat Activities

Combat activities include all things a creature can do on its turn such as actions, bonus actions, free actions, no-action features, and movement.

### Planned Activities

If a combat activity has a target (such as an attack target or movement destination), you need not specify the target during the planning phase.

If a creature’s planned activity is the casting of a spell through means other than Innate Spellcasting feature and the spell has a casting time of 1 action or longer, if the caster takes damage, the caster must make a Concentration check or lose the spell.  If the caster fails the concentration check and the spell has a casting time of longer than 1 action, the spell slot powering the spell is consumed as the magic falls apart.

### Improvised Activities

If a creature’s original plan becomes impossible or undesirable, during the creature’s resolution phase turn, the creature can think quickly on its feet and choose to perform improvised activities instead.  If the cancelled planned activity would have consumed resources, those resources are not consumed unless the activation time of the planned activity was longer than 1 action.

Unfortunately, because the improvised activity was unplanned, the creature cannot fulfill it to the best of their ability.  For an improvised activity, any ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws the creature must make to fulfill it are made with disadvantage.  Similarly, any saving throws it imposes on other creatures to resist the activity’s effects are made with advantage.

## Relevant Feats

### Quick-Witted [New]

Your mind and reflexes sharpen, allowing you to swiftly think through myriad possibilities in combat.  When you improvise activities on your turn, disadvantage due to lack of planning becomes a -1 modifier and creatures making saving throws against your improvised activities only have a +1 modifier.

## Commentary

- Due to rerolling initiative, this essentially mandates use of a VTT so the game is not slowed to a crawl.
- This system is more tactical than the default initiative rules.  Not all tables will prefer that.
- Due to the possibility of spell losses and the penalty of improvisation, it will be more valuable to casters to have fallback options prepared such as Misty Step, Healing Word, or Magic Missile that will always succeed.
- Effects that last until the beginning of a creature’s next turn will sometimes have odd effects if the turn order drastically changes.
- Creatures that are slower will likely want to go last so as to preserve their plans.  This also means that martials characters of any sort will likely want at least some dexterity or intelligence, or at minimum the Alert feat.
