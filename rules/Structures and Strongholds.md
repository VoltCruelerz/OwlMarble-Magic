# Structures and Strongholds

## Overview

Should a player be able to make a reasonable claim on a plot of land, they may build a structure, consisting of an assembly of independent facilities.  Alternatively, an individual could claim an existing structure.

### Phases of Development

Structures are built in three phases per room: Construction, Furnishing, and Decorating.

1. **Construction**: creating the exterior walls, floor, and roof.  A room must meet or exceed its size requirement to be functional.  This cost depends on size and material.
2. **Furnishing**: the costs below for facilities is this cost.  This includes any requisite equipment.
3. **Decorations**: Anything beyond the first two is decorative.

### Permissible Users

Many functions of facilities are restricted.  An individual is considered a permissible user of a structure if they are the owner of the structure or have the permission of one who is.

### Underground Development

The cost of a particular room is doubled if built directly below-ground.  For each additional 10 feet below-ground the floor of a room is, the room’s cost is increased by 50% of its original above-ground cost.  This affects all three phases of development, but does not affect maintenance costs as the number of hirelings is unchanged. Structures built below the surface of water are considered underground.

### Hard Points

Certain structures are especially heavy or prone to experiencing force and require a solid foundation.  Such structures must be built on a "hard point" that covers at least as much area as they do.  Bedrock automatically counts as a hard point, but hard points can also be built from twice the normal cost of structural materials in the construction phase.  Such hard points must be atop another hard point, sunk into the ground, or otherwise sufficiently structurally integrated as the DM may allow.

### Extended Rests

An extended rest is a week of light activity in your own structure without the stresses of being besieged unless the siege has gone on for so long and become so stale that it no longer impacts you.  If you expend your highest level spell slot or are reduced to ¼ of your hit points, this timer resets.

### Stronghold Actions

A stronghold action is a unique action you can take, utilizing a room’s unique capabilities.  Once you use a Stronghold Action, you cannot use another until you complete an extended rest.

### Named Spells

Melf’s Minute Meteors.  Zenith’s Starfall.  Azdregath’s Creeping Concoction.  Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion.  Raogon’s Hierarchy.  The greatest archmages have all created their own spells, and so can you!  When you create a spell, you may name it as you wish.  Will you spread the knowledge of your spells like Mordenkainen for the betterment of all?  Or will you hide your secrets like the Kyburns, fearing what Wish could do in the wrong hands?  Deploying a new spell in public will often get your name attached to it in the public’s mind, whether you want it there or not.

To create a named spell, select one of the below options when you are in an appropriate location (such as when you are a permissible user in an Arcanist’s Study):

- **Customize Existing**: Devising a spell requires 4 weeks (working 8 hours a day for 5 days per week ) plus one week for every level of the root spell and expending 100gp a week.  At the conclusion of your research, roll on the Strongholds and Followers table on SAF24 to determine what headway you were able to make.  You may not customize a spell more than once, but after you have devised a given customization, you may choose to automatically apply it to any future upgrade attempts.  The resulting spell is always one level higher than the root spell.
- **Create New**: You may attempt to create a new spell whole-cloth, but doing so is dangerous, expensive, and time-consuming.  For spells of an inconsequential nature such as Damiana’s Antics, only a day may be required, but for spells of material significance, you must spend 8 weeks, plus an additional 2 weeks for every level of the spell.  You expend 500gp per work week.  At the DM’s discretion, the Strongholds and Followers table may be used for tweaking effects.  After all, magic is not a science.

A portal may be reactivated in the same way.  If a portal remains open for 1 week, a planar ship such as a Spelljammer will appear, bearing a random legendary merchant.  The merchant will be present for 7 days before taking their ship and departing.  7 days following that, another will appear and this cycle continues.

  - Profit: 765/yr
- Alternatives: Lumber Mill, Windmill

### Quarry

- Size: 120x120

Unless placed upon a previously known vein of valuable resources, roll a d100.
1-50: Sedimentary Stone - generates 20d4gp every 30 days
  - Income: 912gp/yr = 30*2.5*12.166
51-70: Igneous Stone - generates 30d6gp every 30 days

  - Cannon: 1500gp, 15 days, knowledge of gunpowder
  - Mangonel: 3000gp, 30 days
  - Ram: 1000gp, 10 days

### Tower

_Requirement: must be built on a hard point_

- Size: 20x20x20
- Cost: 5000gp
- Benefits: Attacks made by defenders in this structure against creatures at least 20 feet below them have their disadvantaged range doubled. If made of stone, this tower counts as a hard point.

### War Room

- Size: 20x20
- Cost: 2500gp
- Benefits: Soldiers friendly to the owner of this structure may have their journeys of up to 7 days planned within this room.  Doing so effectively doubles their overland speed.  A structure containing a war room that is under attack grants a 1d4 to hit for all creatures that would defend it.
- Stronghold Action: **Rally** - creatures and units within 500 feet of your structure are emboldened, becoming immune to charm and fear effects for a number of minutes equal to the activating creature's charisma modifier (minimum 1).  After using this ability, it cannot be used again for 24 hours.
- Alternatives: Bureaucrat’s Office, Map Room

## Tool Facilities

After constructing an empty room, you may create dedicated facilities for a tool type by filling it with valuable equipment.  The larger the room, the more expensive it is, but also the more stations there are.  Many facilities also confer additional benefits.  When you construct a room that supports multiple tool types, you must choose a single tool type for all the room’s stations.

Tool facilities require an unskilled hireling for maintenance.

### Stations

A station is a workspace in a room for a craftsman, complete with tools, easily accessible raw materials, and more elaborate equipment than you would find it a normal tool kit that provides bonuses a basic kit would not.

A station can hold a single project at a time.  A project is something like the creation of a particular potion or forging an individual sword.

If you have more active projects in the room than stations, the extra projects do not gain the benefits of being in the dedicated facilities.  If a project does not spend all its active time at a station, it does not gain the benefits of it.  Collaborative projects require one station for each contributor working at a time.  At the DM's discretion, an especially large or challenging project may require multiple stations.  If a station is destroyed, it may be repaired by spending the cost of the corresponding kit and spending 8 hours.  If multiple kits are supported by the room, roll a die to determine which must be replaced.

### Room Types

#### Tavern

- Tools Supported: Brewer’s Supplies
- Benefits: Taverns are a gathering place for quests and rumors, dispensing 1d4-1 of each every seven days.  Further, the presence of a tavern gives the owner of the structure advantage on Persuasion checks with those who regularly use the tavern.  This is generally assumed to be most of those that live within the structure, as well as an assortment of those living nearby.  It generates 2d10 kegs of alcohol every 7 days worth 5gp each per staffed station.  Each station that is staffed by someone proficient in brewer’s supplies generates alcohol that is 10gp per keg instead.
- Alternatives: Brewery, Brew House, Speak-Easy

- Tools Supported: Alchemist’s Supplies, Calligrapher’s Supplies, Carpenter’s Tools, Cartographer’s Supplies, Cobbler’s Tools, Cook’s Utensils, Forgery Kit, Glassblower’s Tools, Jeweler’s Tools, Leatherworker’s Tools, Mason’s Tools, Painter’s Tools, Potter’s Tools, Tinker’s Tools, Weaver’s Tools, Woodcarver’s Tools
- Benefits: Items created in this room of the corresponding tool type have their DC lowered by 5 and items enchanted with the corresponding tool type do so at an accelerated rate of +50gp worth of materials per day.  All other types of crafting instead increase crafting speed by 50%.
- Alternatives: Laboratory, Study, Studio, Shop, Smithy

#### Theater

- Tools Supported: Disguise Kit, All Instruments
- Benefits: Once per week, each stationed individual on staff generates 1d4sp in ticket sales, or 1d4gp in ticket sales if proficient in an instrument or the disguise kit.  If the character is proficient in Performance, the 1d4 becomes a 1d6.  Theaters occupy rooms are rectangular and are 3 times longer on one side than the normal room size.

### Siege Emplacements

Defensive siege engines produced by the Siege Workshop may be permanently installed for no additional cost beyond their construction cost.

## Room Modifications

### Extradimensional

_Requirement: An owner or hireling that can cast 8th level spells._

- Cost: 20,000gp
- Time: 30 days
- Benefits: The room’s door is actually a portal to a pocket plane, containing the room itself.  The laws of time and gravity in the room are yours to set at time of creating this modifier.  Gravity can be between zero and twice its normal value.  Time can be half to double speed.

### Hidden

- Cost: 500gp
- Time: 5 days
Benefits: This modification hides a room from view such as hiding a doorway behind a bookcase activated by removing a particular book.  A creature that does not know of the hidden room must make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discover the presence of the hidden chamber, then a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to uncover how to enter once they are aware of its presence.

### Secret Passage

- Cost: 1000gp
- Time: 10 days

- Cost: 5000gp
- Time: 20 days
- Benefits: When this rune is first created, choose a command word.

All such runes within one structure share the same command word.

### Trapped

## Hirelings

Hirelings must be paid to continue to render their services.  If they go more than 7 days without pay after they should have been compensated, they will typically desert their post and search for employment elsewhere or begin to actively work against you.  While most facilities within a structure require a dedicated hireling for cleaning, maintenance, or operation, hirelings have uses beyond this.

For every 200x200x200 foot cube your structure occupies, not including fields, even partially, you must manage the area with 1 additional unskilled hireling.  For every 20 hirelings assigned a room or volume, you must also assign a supervisor hireling.  You may have supervisors for supervisors as needed.

- **Unskilled**: 2sp/day
- **Skilled**: 2gp/day
- **Slave** (**Unskilled**): 75gp
- **Slave** (**Skilled**): 750gp

## Further Funds

Running a structure is an expensive enterprise.  As reasonable, you may secure funds through additional means.

### Tithes and Tuition

If your structure is one that draws daily visitors in the form of worshippers or students, you can demand a fee for your services.  Note that excessive prices may drive some individuals away.  This could range from 1sp for a visit to a poor man’s shrine to 2gp daily for a world-class arcane education.  A shrine or temple may receive 50-250 visitors a day, while even a large college should expect a maximum of 100 students.  Luethia Academy, the premier arcane academy, charges 2gp a day and has 500 full-time students.  Many students attend on scholarship.

### Right of Passage

Merchants and travellers through your lands must pay coin for the right to use the roads near your structure.  A small fine of 1cp is typical for minor roads, but major monopolistic trade routes could charge up to 5gp.  Traffic varies on most roads from 2 to 200 travelers.  Excessive tolls may lead to attempts to subvert them.

### Taxation

Nearby villages could pay you tribute in exchange for military protection or bureaucratic operation.  Taxes could run from a reasonable 1cp per household daily to an exorbitant 2sp per household daily.  Note that excessive taxes may lead to revolt.

### Other Sources

Creative players and dungeon masters may invent other ways of creating wealth and the DM should be as amenable as practicable to this.
