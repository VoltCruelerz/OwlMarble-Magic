# Health and Death

## Healing

When a creature is subjected to a healing spell effect with a source spell with a casting time of at least one action, the creature may roll hit dice up to the level of the spell.  Items that heal do not trigger this.

## Death Saves

While a creature is dying, other creatures can attempt a Medicine check on it, even if they do not have a healerâ€™s kit.

- **DC 15**: the creature has advantage on the next death save
- **DC 20**: the creature has advantage on all death saves until it is stabilized or dead

When a creature is stabilized, its successful death saves reset to 0, but its failed saves do not.  Those persist until the creature dies, takes a short rest, or takes a long rest.

Additionally, when a creature makes death saving throws, they are to be private, whispered to the DM only.
