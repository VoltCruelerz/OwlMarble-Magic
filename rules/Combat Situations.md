# Combat Situations

## Flanking [Updated]

When a creature has hostile creatures it can perceive on opposite sides of it, those creatures have +2 to attack rolls, but do not gain advantage unless they have it from some other source.

## High Ground [New]

When you are elevated at least 10 feet above a creature, you have the high ground.  This confers the below benefits.  You are considered elevated compared to another creature if the anchor point of your character is at least 10 feet higher than the anchor point of the other creature, where anchor points are the stabilizing points holding a creature in place.  Most often, this is the feet, but could be the center of mass when flying.  As an example, a Huge-sized giant would not have the High Ground against a goblin standing on the same horizontal plane despite its head and shoulders being more than 10 feet above the Goblin.

- For every 10 feet you are elevated above your opponent for the first 30 feet, your critical hit range increases by 1.
- You gain advantage on perception checks to survey open areas below you.
- If a creature you have the high ground on drops prone, your attacks do not take disadvantage against them.
