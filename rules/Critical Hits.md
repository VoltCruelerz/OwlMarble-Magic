# Critical Hits

## Balance and Limitations

Critical Hits are a mechanism by which combat is made more enjoyable and are a major component of the underlying balancing of D&D 5th Edition due to the mechanic acting as a great equalizer.  Even a lucky Goblin could score a hit on an ancient Dragon.  That said, by the rules as written (RAW), critical hits only apply to attack rolls in combat.  They do not apply to skill checks.

Now, many DMs will allow crits on skill checks…  most of the time.  If you want to persuade a noble and roll a crit, most DMs will say that they go along with it.  It’s fun, it’s rewarding, and the game works out the better for it.  But there are certain things that have wandered into the realm of the absurd, and for these things, a 20 is no different than a 1.  Sometimes, a player will attempt to preempt this by rolling a skill check before the DM calls for it.  Such rolls are invalid.

For a few extreme examples, consider the following.

- Persuade a Lich to give up immortality: a Lich has existed for so long because they are so powerful and determined.  They’re not going to just give up their prized possession.
- Swim up a Waterfall: You are not salmon, and even they have to leap up the waterfalls.
- Shoot the Moon: I don’t care how high your Strength or Dexterity is.  You can’t shoot the moon with an arrow.

A player that says “I want to try to body slam the Tarrasque.  *rolls without being instructed to by DM*  Crit!” is not behaving appropriately, and the DM will not honor that imaginary crit.

## Effect

When a Natural 20 is rolled on a d20 on an Attack Roll, a creature is said to have gotten a Critical Hit.  Instead of doubling the damage dice as is the stock rule, at my table, the damage die is rolled as normal and it has a maximized die of the same size added to the total.  For instance, if you get a crit on a Firebolt spell (1d10) and roll a 1 on the damage, that would be underwhelming by the stock rules as you would only deal 2 points of damage.  Under my house rules, you would instead deal 11 points of damage (d10 + 10).  This ensures crits are always worth it and keeps players from feeling underwhelmed.

Additionally, this helps account for the minor balance difference between spell attacks and save-for-half spells.
