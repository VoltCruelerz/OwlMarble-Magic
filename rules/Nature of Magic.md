# Magic

## Types of Magic

On Faerun, the weave of magic takes several different forms, depending on its origin.

### Cosmic Magic

The background magic of the cosmos that sometimes comes to infuse rocks or other natural features of reality. It is responsible for the divisions between planes. It is often chaotic and seemingly unpredictable, much like weather or volcanic activity. With sufficient study, it becomes general trends can be observed and future behavior can be extrapolated.

### Organic Magic

Creatures that evolve sometimes develop an ability to manipulate magic intrinsically. Magical creatures such as Fae or Celestials fall into this category. When the magic of these creatures “rubs off” on the surrounding environment, it is often difficult to remove except by other organic magic that evolved to counter it.  Additionally, many creatures that use Organic Magic rely on it for their very survival and may quickly die when subjected to antimagic.

### Natural Magic

Even among those life forms that have not properly come to harness magic, by their existence, they shape the magic around them. Druids give this magic direction, shaping the biosphere according to ways that benefit the creatures within it.

### Divine Magic

When creatures become sufficiently suffused with magic, they ascend, and can be in multiple places at once.  Directly intervening in mortal affairs is difficult for gods, so instead they delegate power to their servants, trusting them to use the power wisely.

### Arcane Magic

When magic is understood and treated as a resource that can be exploited, it is considered arcane.

## Mana Generation

Mana, quantized arcane magic, can be used to cast spells and is an integral part of Organic Magic.  It appears on the Astral plane, flows through all other planes, and returns to the Astral plane.

### Organic Generation

#### Cantrips and Magical Effects

Creatures that organically create Mana do so through a River and Dams within the creature’s soul.  As a creature becomes progressively attuned to magic, the River of magic that constantly flows through them grows wider, allowing greater effects.  The creature can then tap this flow to perform cantrips or other Organic effects.  Because these effects rely only on the baseline magic that flows through the creature, so long as the creature is not subject to antimagic, it may continue to produce such effects at will.  It is the increase in this river’s flow (formally known as Impulse) that powers higher grades of cantrips.

#### Spell Slots and Leveled Spells

Some creatures, in addition to their Rivers, also have Dams.  These allow the creature to retain larger volumes of the ambient magic around them, using this magic for surges known as leveled spells.  Another term for a Dam is a Spell Slot.  For a given magical effect, a threshold of magic is required.  

If a spell is provided less than its requisite threshold of Mana, the spell will fail to take shape.  Alternatively, a spell can be provided excessive Mana and still function.  Unfortunately many spells have not been crafted so as to make use of any excess Mana used to cast them.  For spells that do support this, the act of providing excessive Mana is called Up-Casting.

#### Flow Alteration and Regeneration

Most individuals that have Dams only refill them when they rest, but some are able to enter a state of meditation wherein they absorb ambient magic to refill them more rapidly.  Additionally, some others have the ability to transfer Mana between the pools behind the Dams, allowing them to merge smaller reservoirs into larger ones or split a large reservoir into several smaller ones.

#### Isolation

To survive in the presence of others of their kind, creatures possessing Organic magic can slightly suppress and synchronize the fields of magic around them.  In the most dramatic cases, creatures will even have evolved physical Isolation Rings just to survive.  In the case of Angels, were it not for their halos, they would spontaneously detonate due to the massive volumes of magic contained within them.

### Synthetic Generation

#### Mana Reactors

It is possible to create an arcane object that stores Mana known as a Mana Reactor.  These devices are inherently unstable, unfortunately, and require a creature with Organic magic to manage them.  When a creature is not available, they enter a state of hibernation in which they are inert and Mana cannot enter or leave the reactor except in the presence of powerful magic or antimagic.

##### Attunement

While a creature is managing a reactor, the creature is said to be Attuned to the reactor.  Warming up or cooling down a reactor requires a one hour process during which a creature must attune or de-attune the item.  You must completely de-attune an item before attuning a new item in its place.  A creature may attune to up to three Reactors at once.

Also, an item could have multiple Reactors on it, but attempting to Attune to more than one of them at the same time would destroy the item.

#### Mana Nodes

These devices, integrated as part of a Mana Reactor, store Mana, much like Dams do within creatures.  Nodes are not entirely efficient, however, and some of the mana supplied to them flows through them.  This allows cantrips to feed off the excess energy of the reactor.  Such cantrips are known as parasitic cantrips or parasitic enchantments.

#### Runes

Runes are destructive, single use stores of mana.  Once consumed, they cannot be re-created.  Unlike reactors, they do not require attunement.  Less thorough implementations of runes will usually result in the substrate disintegrating.  Alternatively, drawing the runes as the stirring of a fluid will create a potion.  Runes do not require attunement.

#### Saturation

It is possible to turn an entire object into a reactor.  In these cases, the passive generation of the spell and its impulse can lead to triggering the enchanted spell an unlimited number of times.  A saturated enchantment cannot be Isolated, but it may feed parasitic cantrips.  As with reactors, the maximum number of grades of parasitic cantrips is equal to the saturation’s spell level.

### Enchantments

When an item has an attached reactor and an output (such as a consumer), it is said to be enchanted.

#### Flow Consumers

Cantrips can feed off the excess mana flowing through a node.  The maximum number of grades of cantrips that can feed off a given reactor is equal to the reactor’s spell level.

#### Reservoir Consumers

Leveled spells can be fed from reservoirs of nodes.  Casting a spell consumes a single node’s charge.

#### Reactor Isolation

If a reactor is Isolated, parasitic cantrips cannot feed off its generated mana.
