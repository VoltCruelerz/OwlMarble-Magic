## Unarmed Fighting [Updated]

**Classes**: Fighter

When you make an Unarmed Strike, you can choose to use either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll, and the damage dealt on a hit is equal to `1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier` on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

Both of these bonuses expire when initiative ends.

> **Note**: There is no action economy associated with switching between one and two hands.
