## Tampered Fighting [New]

**Classes**: Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger

When you cast a spell on your turn or make a weapon attack, you can draw or sheathe a weapon as part of the same action, potentially freeing a hand for use of a Somatic component in the spell being cast.

Additionally, when you cast a spell, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.

## Unarmed Fighting [Updated]

**Classes**: Fighter

When you make an Unarmed Strike, you can choose to use either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll, and the damage dealt on a hit is equal to `1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier` on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

## Versatile Combatant [New]

**Classes**: Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger

During combat, each time you hit with an attack while wielding a weapon with the _Versatile_ property with one hand, the next two-handed attack with the weapon gains a stacking +1 bonus to its damage, and each time you hit with an attack from such a weapon while wielding it with two hands, the next one-handed attack with the weapon gains a stacking +1 bonus to hit. Both of these bonuses expire when initiative ends.

> **Note**: There is no action economy associated with switching between one and two hands.
