## Versatile Combatant [New]

During combat, each time you hit with an attack while wielding a weapon with the Versatile property with one hand, the next two-handed attack with the weapon gains a stacking +1 bonus to its damage, and each time you hit with an attack from such a weapon while wielding it with two hands, the next one-handed attack with the weapon gains a stacking +1 bonus to hit. Both of these bonuses expire when initiative ends.

> **Note**: There is no action economy associated with switching between one and two hands.
