# Permitted Species

All canon species are permitted except…

- Dragonmark subspecies (setting dependent)
- GGR species (setting dependent)
- Flying species for levels < 5 (flight is bonkers at low levels)

I could be persuaded to allow one of the above, but only if you have a character idea that depends on it that will not cause problems at the table.

## Word of Caution

That said, I’d like to caution against certain species for various reasons.

- **Inconvenient Species**: **Centaurs** are the wrong body form to exist in normal society.  Consider ladders.  **Kenkus** lack creativity.  Small species (**Goblins**, **Halflings**, **Gnomes**) can also be inconvenient, though they usually have strengths in other areas.
- **Attention Hogs**: I strongly discourage these for unskilled players.  **Changelings**, **Kenku**, **Verdan**, and **Eladrin** can either hog the spotlight at the table or become unpleasantly boring.  It’s hard to thread that needle, especially if you’re new to TTRPGs or bad at acting.
- **“Evil” Species**: Most “monstrous” (minotaur, orc, goblinoid, etc) species actually just live in evil societies, so NPCs will likely think you’re evil upon first meeting you, but you can show them otherwise in time.  This also includes Dark Elves in most settings.
- **_Evil_ Species**: Some species actually _are_ evil.  **Lizardfolk** and **Yuan-Ti** lack reciprocity and are universally psychopaths.  **Lizardfolk** will eat you the day you stop being useful and **Yuan-Ti** will simply murder you if it suits them.  It is very hard to make either of these a productive party member in an extended campaign.
- **Extraplanar Species**: **Aarakocra**, **Gith**, **Kalashtars**, **Satyrs**, **Eladrin**, **Genasi**, **Shadar-kai**, **Thri-Kreen**, etc.  Because they’re not from around here, they’ll always be seen as Other.  It also means your backstory will probably matter less in the plot.  Naturally, this only applies if the campaign’s setting doesn’t deal with their plane of origin.
