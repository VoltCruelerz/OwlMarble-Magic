# Travel

## Wilderness Resting

When the party travels through the wilderness and must make camp daily to rest, they can run into challenges resting properly.  When the party would finish a long rest, the PCs must each make a Constitution saving throw with a DC detailed below, based on the number of man hours the spend securing their camp and the hostility of the environment. On a success, they short rest as normal. On a failure, the party benefits from a sleep only.

`DC = max(0, zoneHostility + weatherModifier - floor(manHours/partySize))`

At the DM’s discretion, certain externalities may further increase or decrease this DC.

### Seasons & Weather

| Weather Event | Weather Modifier |
|:-|:-|
| Thunderstorm | 0 |
| Winter | 5 |
| Hurricane | 10 |

### Camp Magic

For spells that make resting easier, such as _Goodberry_ (removing the need for foraging) or _Leomund’s Tiny Hut_ (protection from the elements and monsters), treat the spell as extra man-hours of effort prepping camp equal to the level of the spell for each creature that benefits from it.

### Zone Hostility

The following list provides some basic examples of zone hostility.

| Level | DC | Examples |
|:-----:|:--:|:---------|
| None  | 0 | Civilized indoor areas under normal circumstances. |
| Minimal | 5 | Civilized outdoor areas, such as formalized campgrounds, or civilized indoor areas with moderate disruptions |
| Mild | 10 | Most mundane forests, grasslands, and coastlines would fall under this category. Civilized indoor areas with substantial disruptions also fall under this category. |
| Moderate | 15 | Areas of increased threat such as regions known to have higher monster populations or adverse weather. |

- **DC00 - None**: civilized indoor areas under normal circumstances
- **DC05 - Minimal**: civilized outdoor areas, such as formalized campgrounds, or civilized indoor areas with moderate disruptions
- **DC10 - Mild**: most common inhabited areas such as mundane forests, grasslands, and coastlines would fall under this category. Civilized indoor areas with substantial disruptions also fall under this category.
- **DC15 - Moderate**: areas of increased threat such as regions known to have higher monster populations or adverse weather.  Most low-hostility areas would become moderate-hostility in winter.
- **DC20 - Severe**: areas with serious threats to the survival of the party, usually due to monster infestations or pervasive extreme weather.  Common examples include the arctic or deserts, but could also include forests filled with enemies.  Much of the Underdark would be captured by this level.
- **DC25 - Extreme**: areas where few dare to tread, these regions are usually unnatural, possibly caused by magic run amok or some sort of natural disaster that left the region all but uninhabitable.
- **DC30 - Intolerable**: regions so dangerous they enter myth, these regions are almost certainly the result of cataclysmic events or are claimed as the territory of evil beings of awesome power.  Merely being in these areas might kill a normal person, and even the mightiest heroes can have difficulty sleeping through the night without awakening in fear of the slightest sound.

### Sleeping in Armor

Sleeping in your armor imposes a penalty to your Wilderness Resting Saving Throw.

- **Light**: +1 zone hostility
- **Medium**: +3 zone hostility
- **Heavy**: +5 zone hostility
