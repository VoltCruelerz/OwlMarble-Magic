# Training NPCs

## Introduction

In the event that a player character ever wishes to train another player character or an NPC, there are significant time and resource prerequisites.

Base Stipulations
A character may not train another character up to more than 2 less than the trainer’s level/challenge rating.  In the event of multiclassing, the individual class levels are used.  A 5 Cleric/5 Paladin can’t train recruits up to level 8 in either.  They could, however train recruits up to level 3 in both.
Most recruits will never amount to much.  Commoners are uneducated, untrained, and inexperienced.  Being a wizard, which requires a spell book to read from, is going to be very difficult if you are illiterate.  Similarly, if you grew up in a city, you’re going to have a very hard time being a ranger if you don’t have experience in the woods.  Sure, you can hand any man a spear and tell him to go forward, but proper training is more than that.  Because of this, use the Distributions table below to find out the frequency of a given trait in a population.  Note that a given NPC could potentially have multiple affinities, though this would be very rare.

## Affinity Distributions

Use the following table to determine how many NPCs in a given area possess a given level of natural talent.  Note that the categories do not overlap.  Arcane Magic, for instance is 5, 2, 1.  That means that of the populace, 8% can learn at least the basics of arcane magic.  Note that these numbers are subject to the DM’s discretion.  In an urban hub, Rangers might be a rarity.  In a wealthy trading port, literacy might be more prevalent and so Arcane Magic might be more easily discovered.

- **Minimal Affinity**: These individuals have the bare minimum skills to train in a given field.  NPCs with this level of affinity may not advance past level 1 in a class.
- **Minor Affinity**: These individuals possess legitimate talent for a given skillset.  Training them costs half the time.  NPCs with this level of affinity may not advance past level 3 of a class.
- **Strong Affinity**: These individuals possess a very great natural talent for the skill in question and could go far in life if they pursued this as a profession.  Training them takes a fourth of the time of those with only Minimal Affinity.  Player Characters are considered to have Strong Affinity for any class for which they meet the multiclass prerequisites.

**Update**: use the following for rolling all commoner stats: 5+(4d9)/4+racial.  An individual has minimal affinity with a 12, minor with a 13, and major with a 14 or more.

|   | Minimal Affinity | Minor Affinity (50%) | Major Affinity (25%) |
|:-:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Fighter | 30% | 15% | 5% |
| Ranger | 20% | 10% | 5% |
| Arcane Magic | 5% | 2% | 1% |
| Natural Magic | 5% | 2% | 1% |
| Divine Magic | 5% | 2% | 1% |
| Rogue | 10% | 5% | 2% |

### Training Costs

Training a character costs 5gp per day of training.  

## Martial Training

To get an NPC to the point that it can be used in an organized military, it must first undergo 100 days of either infantry, cavalry, or naval training which requires the trainer to be proficient in all the proficiencies that stand to be gained from the training.  Multiple trainers may work together to ensure all proficiencies are covered.  Officers must thereafter undergo an additional 100 days of training.

Just as with Affinity Distribution, these numbers are subject to DM alteration.  A port city might have a higher prevalence of sailors, while a desert oasis would likely have none.

|   | Minimal Affinity | Minor Affinity (50%) | Major Affinity (25%) |
|:-:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Cavalry | 20% | 10% | 10% |
| Infantry | 70% | 10% | 10% |
| Navy | 40% | 20% | 10% |
| Officer | 25% | 5% | 3% |

After the completion of martial training, they become proficient in the corresponding entry below.  Additionally, officers may be assigned a group of up to 30 soldiers of a lower rank.  Any group with an officer has its AC and attack rolls increased by 1.  To have a higher-rank officer, there must be at least two of a lower rank, both at maximum capacity, beneath it.

- **Infantry**: proficiency with shortsword, pike, shield, and medium armor.  They know how to march in formation and can be used as a phalanx, during which their AC increases by 2.
- **Cavalry**: proficiency with mounted combat, a reach weapon of choice, longswords, and shortbows.
- **Navy**: proficiency with naval combat, light armor, shortswords, scimitars, and cutlasses
- **Officer**: gains the Attack, Defend, and Retreat actions which may change the state of their commanded forces.  A commanded force may only be in one state at a time.
  - **Attack**: all commanded units receive an additional +1 to their attack rolls.
  - **Defend**: all commanded units receive an additional +1 to their AC and have advantage on strength saving throws
  - **Retreat**: all commanded units gain 15 speed when moving away from enemy forces but have disadvantage on charisma saving throws.

## Training Time

The following list details the time required for training.

- **Level 0**. **200 days**: Six months covers the absolute minimal basics of the class.  At this point, the trainees gains two cantrips, a cantrip and a proficiency, or a proficiency.  If the class is capable of learning Prestidigitation, it must be one of the cantrips learned.
- **Level 1**. **200 days**: With the basics covered, another six months is spent on actually becoming not terrible
- **Level 2**. **300 days**: At this point, only those with **Minor** or better affinity continue
- **Level 3**. **500 days**
- **Level 4**. **500 days**: From here on, only those with **Strong** Affinity, also called Adepts may progress, though after level 4, they must rely on adventuring to progress in skill.

Additionally, some conditions will reduce training time.

- **INT Score**: for every point of INT the trainer has above 10, reduce training time by 1%
- **WIS Score**: for every point of WIS the trainer has above 10, reduce training time by 1%
- **CHA Score**: for every point of CHA the trainer has above 10, reduce training time by 1%
- **Battlemaster**: Battlemaster fighters can act as excellent trainers of Infantry, Fighters, Cavalry, and Navies, reducing training time by 15% and all others by 5%.
- **Professors**: Those with the Sage-Professor background can act as excellent trainers of Officers and Arcane Magic, reducing training time by 15% and all others by 5%.
- **Acolytes**: Those with the Acolyte background can act as excellent trainers for natural and divine magic, reducing training time by 20%.

## Examples

Thus, as an example in a town of 100 people, 5 will have minimal affinity for arcane magic.  Training the lot of them to even just be able to use the Firebolt and Minor Illusion would take 200 days, plus 5gp for each of the five of them, so the total cost will come to 5,000gp, a cost that is definitely not insubstantial.  If the trainer was a Professor with 20 INT and 20 CHA, however, training time would be reduced by `15+10+10=35%` which would shave off 70 days and 1,750gp, a very respectable amount.  If the Professor was tutoring select Strong Affinity students in a city, they would grow in power even faster.

In practice then, what this means is that you can trade 5000gp for 27.5 DPR.  If you wanted to do something like train an entire populace of a city to fight back against an ancient dragon by using Magic Missile spam, you would need to expend 400 days training 30 trainees to level 1 in Wizard, costing a grand total of 60,000gp.  Certainly, having an archmage professor would help with this, but it will only cut into it so far.  It will still be a monumentally expensive task.  That said, thereafter, you have a force of 30 wizards that can mass fire on even the most ancient of dragons to lay them low in one or two volleys.  When combined with the might of the party, it is very unlikely the dragon will survive even the first barrage.
