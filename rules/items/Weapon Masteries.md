# Weapon Masteries

Each weapon now has a Mastery property, as shown in the weapon tables. That property is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character.

If a game feature lets you replace a weapon’s Mastery property with another one, that weapon must meet any prerequisite specified  or the new property.

## Cleave [Updated]

_Prerequisite: Melee Weapon, Heavy Property_

If you hit a creature with a melee attack using this weapon, you can make an attack roll with the weapon against a second creature that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage, unless that modifier is negative.

If the target of the original attack was of a larger size class than you, you can choose to make the second attack against the same creature.

You can make this extra attack only once per turn.
