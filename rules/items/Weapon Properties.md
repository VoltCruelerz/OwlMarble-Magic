# Weapon Properties

## Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged Attack only if you have Ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you Attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of Ammunition. Drawing the Ammunition from a Quiver, case, or other container is part of the Attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended Ammunition by taking a minute to Search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee Attack, you treat the weapon as an Improvised Weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

## Couched [New]

If you are not mounted, this weapon also has the Two-Handed property.

## Dismounting [New]

When an attack is made against a mounted combatant with this weapon, on a hit, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to half the damage dealt or be dismounted, landing prone within 5 feet of the mount.

## Extended Reach [New]

This weapon adds 10 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it. This weapon also counts as a Reach weapon for the purpose of features that interact with the property.

## Finesse

When making an Attack with this weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the Attack and Damage Rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

## Handy [New]

A hand, arm, or wrist fitted with this weapon still counts as a free hand.

## Heavy

Small creatures have disadvantage on Attack rolls with this weapon.

## Inner Range [New]

Attacks made by this weapon against targets this distance away or closer have disadvantage.

## Light

A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when [fighting with two weapons](../Two-Weapon%20Fighting.md).

## Loading

Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of Ammunition from it when you use an Action, bonus Action, or Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

## Parrying [New]

When you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon in one hand and are holding this weapon in your off-hand that you are proficient with, if you do not attack with this weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to increase your AC by 1 until the start of your next turn.

## Range

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged Attack has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s Long Range. When Attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the Attack roll. You can’t Attack a target beyond the weapon’s Long Range.

## Reach

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you Attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

## Thrown

You can throw this weapon to make a ranged Attack. If this weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that Attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee Attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the finesse property.

## Two-Handed

This weapon requires two hands when you Attack with it.

## Versatile [Updated]

This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee Attack.

During combat, each time you hit with an attack while wielding the weapon with one hand, the next two-handed attack gains a stacking +1 bonus to its damage, and each time you hit with an attack while wielding the weapon with two hands, the next one-handed attack gains a stacking +1 bonus to hit. Both of these bonuses expire when initiative ends.
