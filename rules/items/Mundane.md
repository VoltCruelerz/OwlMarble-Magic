# Mundane Items

These rules are for describing assorted items and equipment that is nonmagical.
## Equipment

### Weapons

#### Weapon Properties

- **Dismounting**: When an attack is made against a mounted combatant, on a hit, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to half the damage dealt or be dismounted, landing prone within 5 feet of the mount.
- **Extended Reach**: Items with this property also have the reach property, but instead add 10 feet to your range.
- **Inner Range**: Attacks made by this weapon against targets this distance away or closer have disadvantage.
- **Couched**: Weapons with this property have the Two-Handed trait when you are not mounted.
- **Handy**: A hand, arm, or wrist fitted with this weapon still counts as a free hand.
- **Parrying**: When you take the Attack action and attack with a melee weapon in one hand and are holding a weapon with this trait in your off-hand that you are proficient with, instead of engaging in two-weapon fighting, you can use a bonus action to increase your AC by 1 until the start of your next turn.

## Stone Shape Crafting

To do fine detail with Stone Shape, you make a series of checks with a cumulative DC.  A statue of a person might be 200 for a super realistic one, but even a single cast could make a biped shape.  If you stop somewhere along the way, that is the resulting quality.

`New Value = d20+Performance-(old value/20)+old value`

If using conventional means, errors accumulate.  If the value declines more than your proficiency bonus, the error can't be worked around and all checks to work on it thereafter have a -1 modifier that accumulates with multiple failures.

## Spellbooks

A spellbook has 100 pages and each level of a spell copied into it occupies one page.  Cantrips can be copied in, but cantrips so copied will not be permanently learned and instead must count as a prepared spell, the advantage of which being that they can be cast at will.  A cantrip occupies a fourth of a page per grade.

## Raw Materials

### Statistics

- **Armor Class**: an attack roll must meet or exceed this to cause damage
- **Vulnerabilities/Resistances/Immunities**: how that pure material behaves. It does not necessarily confer these to objects behind them. Example: cloth is immune to bludgeoning, but you're not.  All inanimate materials are immune to Psychic and Poison damage.
- **Special**: some materials have special properties.
- **Damage Threshold**: the damage threshold for a tiny object of that material that fully fills its cube.  Each size class higher doubles the threshold. (Small=2x, Medium=4x, Large=8x). Objects that do not fill their cube may count as a size lower or more, depending on internal structure. If an object takes damage below its threshold, it is only surface damage and its HP is not reduced.  If it receives damage above its damage threshold, it receives the full damage. Threshold calculations occur after all others.
- **Reductive Threshold**: similar to DT, but when an object with an RT takes damage above its threshold, that damage is reduced by the threshold before it is applied to it's HP.
