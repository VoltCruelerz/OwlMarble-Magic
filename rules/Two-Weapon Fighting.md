# Two-Weapon Fighting

> ## Problem
>
> The issue with Two-Weapon fighting is that at early levels, it is incredibly powerful, but falls off hard once Extra Attack comes into play.  Additionally, because two-weapon fighting eats a bonus action, it competes with effects that are clearly superior and falls even further out of favor.  The change below reduces the accuracy of TWF to balance it early-game and allows it to scale into the late-game.

## Two-Weapon Fighting [Updated]

While you are wielding two light weapons you are proficient with, you may engage in two-weapon fighting on your turn.  When you make a weapon attack through the Attack Action or the Extra Attack feature, you may make a second attack using your off-hand weapon.  You do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack rolls of either attack, and the off-hand attack does not add your ability modifier to its damage.

> **Note**: The feat _Dual Wielder_ and the fighting style _Two-Weapon Fighting_ are unchanged.
