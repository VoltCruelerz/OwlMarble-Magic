# Level 6

## Alter Landscape

_replaces Move Earth_

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils- clay, loam, and sand)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 2 hours
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose an area of terrain as large as a 40-foot square.  You may reshape dirt, sand, clay, gravel, snow, and ice in the area in any manner you choose for the duration.  You can raise or lower the area's elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar.  The extent of any such changes can't exceed half the area's largest dimension.  It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.  Because these changes occur slowly, creatures in the area can't usually be trapped or injured by the ground's movements.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on this spell, you may choose a new area of terrain to affect.

This spell can't manipulate bedrock or stone construction.  Rocks and structures may shift to accommodate the new terrain.  If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.  Similarly, this spell does not directly affect plant growth.  The moved earth carries any plants along with it.

## Arcane Artillery

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 1200 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (three red diamons, each worth 100gp)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You launch three brilliant spheres of light into the sky that streak toward three points of your choice on the exposed ground or exterior of structures.  The spheres arc through the air and land at the end of your next turn.  As they fly, they provide bright light within 1000 feet and dim light within another 1000.  Each sphere deals 10d6 fire damage to all creatures and uncontrolled objects within a 15 foot radius on a failed dexterity saving throw; a creature receives half damage on success.  A creature does not receive additional damage if it is within the area of multiple spheres.

A creature that can see the orbs flying can predict their destination on a bonus action intelligence check.  If the creature uses its action instead to make the check, it has advantage.

- **\> 25**: the creature can identify the target point of one orb.
- **\> 20**: creature believes the target of one orb is near a random point within 30 feet of the actual target.  Use 1d8 for the direction and a d6*5 for magnitude.
- **\> 15**: creature believes the target of one orb is roughly near a random point within 100 feet of the actual target.  Use 1d8 for the direction and a d20*5 for magnitude
- **Otherwise**: creature cannot reasonably identify a landing zone, but can determine the general heading.
If the orbs are targeted with antimagic, they must be targeted separately.

**Mass Combat**: When used in Mass Combat, this spell is not capped by at an _Effect Scale_ of 20 against a single _Formation_.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 6th this is cast at, another orb is created.

## Distort Life

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Hour
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a silver sculpture of the creature in its desired form worth 500gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Warlock, Wizard

You touch a pregnant creature or an inhabited egg and attempt to alter any developing fetuses inside it.  If the pregnant creature has an intelligence of at least 6, it may make a Constitution saving throw on behalf of its child to resist the effects.  On a failure, a willing pregnant mother, or use of the spell directly on an egg, you may select one option from the list below.

### Options

- **Aesthetic**: You may make a number of non-functional alterations to a creature's appearance, up to your spellcasting ability modifier.  This includes changes such as attractiveness, skin or fur coloration, hair curliness, or the ability to glow faintly in the dark without casting useful light.  You may not add or remove appendages, horns, hair, or similar extrusions with this option.  This change always succeeds.
- **Size**: You may increase or decrease the fetus's destined size class by one tier.  If increasing, upon giving birth, the mother must make a DC18 Constitution saving throw or receive slashing damage equal to twice the newborn's maximum hit points.  On a success, she receives half as much.
- **Flavor Trait**: You may add or remove one trait from the fetus, provided that this change does not have the potential to increase its CR.  These can include changes such as adding a prehensile tail, changing alignment, changing diet, increasing speed by 10 feet, or changing a water breathing species to be air breathing or amphibious.  You have advantage on checks made to make this type of change.
- **Power Trait**: You may add or remove a trait that has the potential to increase the creature's challenge rating.  See DMG 280 for details.  The DM has wide latitude to interpret the emergent challenge rating due to multiple traits interacting.  For certain changes, the amount that can be added in one casting of this spell is limited.  The following should be considered guidelines for other player-desired changes.
  - **AC**: +1
  - **Add Melee Attack**: adding an initial attack will deal 1d4+strength mod.
  - **Add Ranged Attack**: adding an initial ranged attack will deal 1d4+dexterity mod.
  - **Add Breath Weapon**: may be any element, deals 2d6 on a failed Dexterity save against a Charisma-based DC, half on success.
  - **Upgrade Attack**: increase an attack's number of damage dice by 1 or increase damage die size by one.  Damage die size cannot exceed hit die size.
  - **Add Extra Attack**: Allows a creature to make an extra attack per round.  A creature can have no more attacks per round than its speed divided by 6.
  - **Increase Ability Score**: increase an ability score by 2, increase two ability scores by one, or grant a feat.  A creature's ability score cannot be upgraded beyond your spellcasting level plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
  - **Add Hit Dice**: increase the number of hit dice by two.
  - **Add Proficiency**: add two skill proficiencies, three weapon proficiencies (provided it has reasonable means to use them), one armor proficiency (working up from light), or one saving throw proficiency.  You may not grant a creature proficiency in a skill unless it has a score of 8 or higher in the base ability score.
  - **Innate Spellcasting**: on the first use of this option, the creature starts life with a cantrip and a once-a-day 1st level spell.  Thereafter, through castings of this spell, you may add a new spell of a level it can cast and increase the spells of that level per day by 1, add two cantrips, add two spells of levels it can cast, or increase maximum spell level and allow one use of the new level per day.  A creature cannot have more spell usages a day of a given level than it has of the levels below it.

Upon the birth or hatching of the offspring, make a spellcasting ability modifier check (unless stipulated otherwise above).  The DC depends on the size class of the altered creature and the intended CR of the creature once it reaches adulthood.

### Difficulty Class

| Size       | DC                        |
|:----------:|:-------------------------:|
| Tiny       | `CEIL(MAX(15, CR + 14.5)` |
| Small      | `CEIL(MAX(15, CR + 13))`  |
| Medium     | `CEIL(MAX(15, CR + 11))`  |
| Large      | `CEIL(MAX(15, CR + 9))`   |
| Huge       | `CEIL(MAX(15, CR + 7))`   |
| Gargantuan | `CEIL(MAX(15, CR + 5))`   |

### Roll Implications

- On a success, the creature is exactly as you intended, and its traits are heritable.
- On a failure of 5 or less, the creature is mostly as you intended, but with a beneficial trait missing or an extra negative trait; the creature is sterile without the aid of magic.  
- On a failure of 6-10, the spell fails to take hold, but creature is a healthy member of its parents' species with no changes.  If the mother would have had to make a saving throw due to a size increase, she no longer does.
- On a failure greater than 10, the creature is stillborn and cannot be resurrected by any means.

If you needed to make this check and the spell takes hold, the creature is considered a monstrosity, in addition to whatever class its parents are.

You may cast this more than once on a given fetus, but each successive casting increases the DC by 2.

## Dragon's Sight

- **School**: Divination
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action Ritual
- **Range**: 1000 miles
- **Components**: V, S, M (a table covered in sand mixed with finely ground diamonds worth 1000gp)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Wizard

When you cast this spell, you name a settlement or geographical feature within range.  The sand on the table then reshapes itself into the topography and structures in a radius up to 10 miles around the center of the specified location.  The spell grants sufficient detail to make out the presence or absence of major features, large buildings, blocks of smaller buildings, or large troop formations, but is incapable of finer detail.  The map updates in real time.

If a spell of 5th level or higher is cast within the target area and the origin of the spell is not behind 1 foot of material or a thin sheet of metal, a flash of color for the school of magic, per the [Detect Magic](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/01.md#detect-magic) spell, will appear in the corresponding location on the sand table.

## Flash Flood

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 600 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a water reed)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Wizard

You summon torrential rains from the sky to inundate a 150-foot radius column centered on a point you can see within range. Nonmagical flames in the column are extinguished and vapor clouds such as _Fog Cloud_ or [Cloudkill](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/05.md#cloudkill) are harmlessly dispersed. Magma within the radius solidifies and the surface of the ground becomes flooded in 6 feet of water, compelling Large or smaller creatures to swim.  When a Huge or larger walking creature or a flying creature without the Hover feature either enters the column or begins its turn there, it is immediately soaked and must make a Strength saving throw.  On a failure, walking creatures fall prone and flying creatures drop 40 feet.

After the spell ends, such as through [Dispel Magic](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/03.md#dispel-magic), duration expiration, or broken concentration, the area is rendered difficult terrain by the leftover muck.

This spell fails if the target point does not have a clear view of the sky.

## Harm

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a curse allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

**Higher Levels**: For each level higher, damage increases by 3d6.

## Isabelle's Entailment

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1 round
- **Classes**: Cleric

You can only cast this spell at the beginning of your turn.  Select a humanoid you can see within range.  The target creature can use its reaction to immediately take an additional turn.  This turn does not restore the creature’s reaction.  You are paralyzed from the beginning of the target creature’s extra turn until the beginning of your next turn.

## Mental Prison

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You attempt to bind a creature with an illusory cell that only it perceives.  One creature you can see within range must make an Intelligence saving throw.  The target automatically succeeds if it is immune to being charmed.  On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends.

On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 Psychic damage, and you make the area immediately around the target appear dangerous to it in some way.  You might cause it to hallucinate that it is surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws of teeth.  Whatever form the hallucination takes, the target can’t see or hear anything beyond it and it is restrained for the duration.  If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, it takes 10d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends.

## Nightmare

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a decapitated stuffed animal)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You flood the target's mind with momentary vivid hallucinations of its own gruesome, gloryless death, dealing 30d4 Psychic damage to the target from the psychological trauma of it.  A creature that is not unconscious before damage is applied may attempt an Intelligence saving throw to see the illusion for what it is, taking only half damage on success.  If this spell does not reduce the target to zero hit points, the hallucinations fade, and the target's mind begins to return to normal.  At the end of each of its next two turns, it heals back one fourth of the damage taken after resistances and immunities.

**Higher Levels**: For each level higher, damage increases by 5d4.

## Programmed Illusion

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25gp)
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Classes**: Bard, Wizard

You create an audiovisual figment that activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the figment behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the figment springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the figment finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the figment can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create a figment of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the figment to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

## Raogon's Hierarchy

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (a piece of tempered glass)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

Whenever you are subjected to a level 1 spell or a grade 1 cantrip, you can elect to have the attack miss if it is not a critical hit and to automatically succeed on any saving throws against such spells.

**Higher Levels**: When cast at 7th level, the effects extend to spells cast with a second level slot.  At 8th, effects apply to third level slots.  At 9th, when you cast a spell, you can elect to disregard protective magic from 1st level spells and grade 1 cantrips.

## Sunbeam

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (60-foot line)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A brilliant beam of light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-line.  Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn.  On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not blinded.  Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

For the duration, a mote of radiant sunlight shines in your hand, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for 30 feet beyond that. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to create a new line of radiance.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 6th this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d8.

## Superior Invisibility

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.  Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.  The effects of this spell cannot be penetrated by Infravision.

Additionally, when you cast this spell, you may designate any number of creatures you can see.  These creatures see a ghostly translucent version of the invisible creature and are therefore able to see it for the purpose of targeting spells or other magical effects.

## Tenser's Transformation

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (a red flag)
- **Duration**: 12 hours
- **Classes**: Wizard

You endow yourself endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic.  Spells of limited time duration that you previously cast on yourself immediately expire.  Until this spell ends, you cannot concentrate on spells, cannot cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:

- Your maximum hit points increase by 50 and your current hit points increase by the same amount.
- You have advantage on all attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra 3d6 Force damage.
- You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.
- You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.  You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature that grants you extra attacks such as Extra Attack.

You may terminate this spell as an action.  If the spell persisted for more than 8 hours, you receive a level of exhaustion when the spell ends.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher this spell is cast at, the maximum hit point bonus is increased by 10 and weapon attacks you make deal an extra 1d6 damage on hit per slot level above 6th.

## Transport via Plants

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 10 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 round
- **Classes**: Druid

You target a Large or larger plant within range and open a portal through it to another Large or larger plant on the same plane of existence.  You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before.  For the duration, any creature that steps through the portal can traverse it by using 5 feet of movement.

## Wall of Ice

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Wizard

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a 100 foot wall or hemispherical dome or a sphere with a 10 foot radius.  In any case, it is composed of [Wall of Ice Panel](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#wall-of-ice-panel)s. The wall must be contiguous.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

When a panel is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in its space for the spell's duration. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.
