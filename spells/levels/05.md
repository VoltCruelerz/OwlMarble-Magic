# Level 5

## Accord

- **School:** Enchantment
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (high quality ink and parchment worth 50gp, which is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Special
- **Classes:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard

Over the course of casting this spell, you create a magically binding contract.  Any creature that later willingly signs the contract is bound by it, and a copy of the contract is magically created for them that will update itself if other creatures sign in the future.  If a creature violates the contract, all other signatories instantly become aware.

The contract can only be nullified if the original and all the copies created for the signatories are destroyed.

A creature that violates the contract receives necrotic damage equal to 10 times the level of the spell slot used to cast this and ceases to be bound by it.  When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the following effects to apply instead.  If the option requires additional configuration options, you must specifiy them when you create the contract.  If the option requires saving throws, the offending creature automatically fails them, even if they have legendary resistances.

- The creature is affected by the _Geas_ spell cast at the same level as this spell.  The instructions it is compelled to follow must be dictated in the contract.
- The creature is afflicted with one of the options of the [Bestow Curse](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/03.md#bestow-curse) spell.  The effect is permanent, and can only be removed by a _Remove Curse_ spell cast at the same level.
- The creature is affected by a spell of your choice that you know or have prepared that is no higher than the spell slot level used to cast this spell.

## Altered Appearance

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 12 Hours
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (1000gp worth of silver dust that is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You permanently alter the appearance of a Medium or Small creature.  The new body must be of the same size class and body form and may be no more than 1 foot shorter or taller.  The new body can be short, tall, fat, thin, attractive, ugly, or any degree of combinations of the above.  A creature may also be endowed with nonfunctional additions such as horns, wings, or a tail.  Alternatively, functional versions of those that a creature already has may be removed.  Should the subject of the spell thereafter sire or bear children, the traits will not be passed on unless subjected to an effect such as [Breed True](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/04.md#breed-true).

**Higher Levels**: If cast at 7th level or above, this spell can be applied to Large creatures (+/- 2 feet) or Tiny creatures (+/- 1 inches).

## Alton's Spirit Swarm

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a family heirloom)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You conjure a swarm of silent spirits from the Shadowfell to occupy a 40-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range.  At the end of the turn on which you cast it, the spirits become invisible.  For the duration, roll a d6 as a collision die when a creature enters the cube for the first time on its turn or begins its turn there.  If the roll is a 3 or higher, a spirit collides with the creature and dissipates with a screech that deals 7d6 thunder damage to the creature and can be heard from 300 feet away.

Each time a creature collides with a spirit, the roll required to achieve a collision increases by one.  Thus, the second collision requires a roll of at least 4.  The third at least 5.  The fourth at least 6.  If no more collisions are possible, the spell ends.

If a creature possesses Truesight or can see into the Ethereal Plane, it may freely navigate the area without risking a collision.

**Higher Levels**: When this spell is cast at a spell level above 5th, the collision die increases in size.  At 6th, the collision die is a d8.  At 7th, it is a d10.  At 8th, it is a d12.  At 9th, it is a d20.

## Animate Objects

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to 8 nonmagical Huge or smaller uncontrolled objects within range.  Medium objects count as 2.  Large objects count as 4.  Huge objects count as 8.  Each object animates and becomes a creature under your control as an [Animated Object](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#animated-object) until the spell ends or it is reduced to 0 hit points.  The animated objects take their turns immediately after yours.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creatures you make with this spell if they are within 500 feet of you.  The commands can be specific or general such as “guard this room.”  Once given an order, a creature will continue to follow it until its task is complete.  If a creature has no task, it will defend itself, but take no other actions.

An [Animated Object](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#animated-object) is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size (see below).  If it lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying (hover) speed of 30 feet.  If the object is securely attached to a larger object (such as a chain bolted to the floor), its speed is 0.  When an animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to the original object.

If an animated object attacks, it makes a slam attack against a creature or uncontrolled object within 5 feet of it.  The attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate for the object.  This damage is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances.

### Animated Object Statistics

| Size       | HP | AC | Attack       | Damage       | STR | DEX | CR |
|:----------:|:--:|:--:|:------------:|:------------:|:---:|:---:|:--:|
| Tiny       | 15 | 18 | [[/r d20+8]] | [[/r 1d6+4]] | 4   | 18  | 1  |
| Small      | 25 | 17 | [[/r d20+6]] | [[/r 1d8+3]] | 6   | 16  | 1  |
| Medium     | 50 | 16 | [[/r d20+6]] | [[/r 2d8+3]] | 16  | 14  | 2  |
| Large      | 90 | 14 | [[/r d20+7]] | [[/r 4d8+4]] | 18  | 12  | 3  |
| Huge       | 120| 12 | [[/r d20+8]] | [[/r 8d8+5]] | 20  | 8   | 5  |

**Higher Levels**: If you cast this spell using a spell slot higher than 6th, you can animate 2 additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

## Arbitration

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Wizard

You and up to six other willing creatures in range swear an oath of neutrality that is magically enforced for the duration of the spell.  If this spell attempts to target a creature that is unwilling, the spell informs the other targets of the spell who rejected it, and then ends.

For the duration of the spell, the targets of the spell cannot attack, damage, grapple, restrain, or target each other spells without the target’s consent.  If a target of the spell takes damage, the spell ends on all targets.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell slot higher than 5th this is cast with, this spell can target an additional two creatures.

## Banish Air

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You magically banish the air from a 20-foot cube and prevent new air from entering the volume for the duration of the spell.  Nonmagical flame within the volume is instantly extinguished and Small pools of water-based and oil-based liquids boil away instantly, their fumes expelled from the spell's area of effect.  Vapor clouds are also instantly dispersed within the volume.  Creatures within the spell's area receive 8d6 force damage, and must hold their breath.  When the spell ends, air is allowed to harmlessly flow back in from the surroundings.  When cast underwater, creatures that can ordinarily breathe water must also hold their breath while in the volume, but the spell deals no damage.

Incorporeal air and fire elementals that begin their turns within the volume or enter the volume for the first time on their turn must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be ejected and be unable to reenter the volume until the start of their next turn.

**Higher Levels**: When cast with a 6th level spell slot, the duration increases to 10 minutes.  At 7th, it increases to 1 hour and no longer requires concentration.  At 8th, it lasts for 24 hours.  At 9th, it lasts for 1 week.

## Blizzard

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 200 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a snowball with a rock inside it)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A whirling, freezing Blizzard appears as a 60 foot radius column with a height of 40 feet centered on a point you can see within range.  The effects of this spell extend around corners, but not through solid barriers.

A very strong (40 mph) wind appears and disperses all gas and vapor cloud effects, including a Black Dragon's breath and spells like [Cloudkill](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/05.md#cloudkill), but does not move air back into magically evacuated spaces such as by [Banish Air](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/05.md#banish-air).  The wind also extinguishes all exposed natural flame and magical flame cast from a spell level below the level of this spell.

The ground is covered in icy snow, rendering it difficult terrain.  Any creature that ends its turn within the column must make a Constitution save or receive 6d6 Cold damage, half on success.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d6.

## Caustic Blaze

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and mustard)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

A 60-foot cone of green fire issues forth from your hands.  Creatures caught in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive 3d8 fire damage and 3d8 acid damage.  A successful save halves the damage for that creature.  Uncontrolled objects and surfaces not made of metal in the cone ignite and burn for one minute, even if they are not normally flammable.  Creatures that enter the flames for the first time on their turn or begin their turn there receive 1d4 Fire damage and 1d4 Acid damage.  These flames cannot be extinguished with water or vacuum, nor can they be dispelled.

**Higher Levels**: For each slot higher than 5th this is cast with, the initial fire damage increases by 1d8.

## Cloudkill

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You create a completely opaque toxic cloud 20 feet in diameter of yellow-green gas that appears at a point of your choice within range that spreads around corners.  It lasts for the duration of the spell or until it is dispersed by a strong wind, such as by the [Blizzard](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/05.md#blizzard) spell.

When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or begins its turn there, it is subjected to the cloud's toxic effects, even if it holds its breath or does not need to breathe.  It must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 5d8 Poison damage and begins hemorrhaging if it is not immune to poison.  On a success, the creature receives half damage and does not begin hemorrhaging.

When a creature is hemorrhaging, it has disadvantage on visual Perception checks as it bleeds from its eyes, and all sources of damage are especially harmful.  Each time it takes damage, its current and maximum hit points are reduced by 1d4 until the end of its next long rest.  A creature that is hemorrhaging but no longer in the cloud can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The cloud created by this spell is heavier than air and sinks downward when possible, passing through grates, descending slopes, and dropping off cliffs.  When sinking in this way, the cloud moves at a maximum of 10 feet at the end of each of your turns.  The cloud will not sink into liquids.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 5th this is cast at, the Hemorrhaging damage die increases by one size (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20).

## Command Vessel

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes**: Artificer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

For the duration, a huge or smaller target vehicle bends to your will.  On your turn, you can mentally command the vehicle to move (no action required by you), even if it is not crewed or it would ordinarily not have propulsion, such as due to lack of a draft animal or lack of wind.

The vehicle’s speed is 60, unless its speed would otherwise be higher.  The spell ends early if you leave the vehicle or the vehicle is reduced to 0 hit points.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target gargantuan vehicles with this spell.  If cast at 8th level or higher, the vehicle gains a fly (hover) speed of 120, even if would not ordinarily have one.

## Creation

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Special
- **Classes**: Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

You create a shadow figment to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range such as soft good, rope, wood, or something similar.  You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal.  The objects created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material.  If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

- **Vegetable Matter**: 1 day
- **Stone/Crystal/Common Metals**: 12 hours
- **Precious Metals**: 1 hour
- **Gems**: 10 minutes
- **Adamantine/Mithril**: 1 minute

Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material component causes that spell to fail.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

## Dawn

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a sunburst pendant worth 100gp)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Wizard

The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range.  Until the spell ends, a 30-foot radius, 400-foot high cylinder of bright light glimmers there, and dim light is cast 30 feet outside the radius.  The light within the cylinder is Sunlight.  When the cylinder appears, each creature within it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder or enters the cylinder for the first time on its turn.

If you are within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet to a new point within range as a bonus action.

**Higher Levels**: For each slot higher than 5th this is cast with, the damage increases by 1d10.

## Dream

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Special
- **Components**: V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Bard, Warlock, Wizard

This spell shapes a creature’s dreams.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell.  The target must be on the same plane of existence as you.  Creatures that don’t sleep, such as Elves, cannot be contacted by this spell.  You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger.  While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but cannot take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell.  The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images.  The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early.  The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.  If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger enters the target’s dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target.  If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than 10 words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save, the echoes of the monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents it from gaining any benefit from that rest.  Additionally, when it wakes, it receives 3d6 Psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping of a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes the saving throw for this spell with disadvantage.

## Force Blast

- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 300 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a hammer)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

- **Range**: Self (50-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 8 hours
- **Classes**: Cleric

You begin to glow a brilliant golden-white, shedding bright light for 25 feet and dim light for 25 feet beyond that.  

Golden waves of power radiate from you for the duration, affecting all friendly creatures within your light for as long as they remain within it.  Any affected creature begins to shed dim light out to 5 feet.  Additionally, select one of the following benefits to confer on creatures within range.

- +1 to Hit
- +1 to AC
- +1 to Critical Hit Range
- +10 to Movement Speed
- +1 to Morale

**Mass Combat**: In mass combat, this spell affects a formation only if you begin your turn in that formation's space.

**Higher Levels**: For each slot higher than 5th this is cast with, select another effect from the list to simultaneously apply to the targets of this spell.  You may select the same benefit more than once, stacking the effects.

## Immolation

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You wreath a creature you can see within range in flames.  It receives 8d6 fire damage, and at the beginning of each of its following turns, must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive the damage again.  On a success, it receives only half and the spell ends.  This spell cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means.  While the target burns, it emits bright light for 30 feet and dim light for another 30 feet beyond that.  If this spell reduces a creature to zero hit points, the creature is burned to ash.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell slot this is cast with above 5th level, the damage increases by 1d6.

## Irnar's Fast Pregnancy

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Wizard

You magically advance a creature's pregnancy, and reduce the remaining gestation time by 90% as the fetus rapidly develops.  When she gives birth, if castings of this spell have reduced the actual gestation time to less than half her natural gestation time, she must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 2d10 Necrotic damage.  If she is unwilling and has an Intelligence above four, she may make a Constitution saving throw to resist this spell when it is cast upon her, rendering her immune to it for the next 24 hours.

## Mislead

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Wizard

You create a glamor on yourself to become invisible at the same time you produce a figment that appears where you are standing and takes on your appearance.  The invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell, but the figment lasts for the duration.

You can use your action to move the figment up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.  On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to your own or back again.  While you use the senses of either, you are blinded and deafened to the senses of the other.

## Reposition

- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: 200 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You and all willing creatures within 50 feet of you are teleported to a target point within range, your relative positions to each other remaining the same.  If a creature would find its position filled, it is safely shunted to the nearest open space.

- **Spring**: Heavy rains and fog pour down, removing gas clouds, lightly obscuring things beyond 20 feet, and heavily obscuring things beyond 60 feet.  Immediately when you cast the spell and then again at the start of each of your turns, each creature in the radius regains 1 hit point.  A given creature may not benefit from more than 10 recovered hit points from this spell in a 24-hour period.

## Sinkhole

- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

Select a 20-foot cube of natural terrain within range that you can see.  If the cube is supporting any artificial structures, this spell fails.  By your magic, you then banish any non-magical earth, mud, stone, sand, lava, ice, snow, or water in the target volume.  Any creatures or plants atop the banished volume then fall in, receiving fall damage at the bottom.  If a creature is within 5 feet of the edge of the sinkhole when it appears, it may attempt an Acrobatics check against your spell save DC to grab the ledge and hold on.  SAt the DM's discretion, some plants may also remain suspended, depending on if their roots extend into solid ground.

If this spell is used underwater, the water is banished, but then the surrounding water rushes in rapidly with crushing pressure to fill the void.  Creatures caught in the area receive 8d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher this is cast at, the cube's faces increase in size by 5 feet.

## Sterilize

- **School**: Evocation

- **Range**: Self (100-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a stone taken from the crater of Arcane Annihilation)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric, Wizard

A brilliant green wave of energy sweeps out from you that penetrates all physical matter, dealing 3 points necrotic of damage to all creatures and plants other than you within the radius, even parasites and possessors that would otherwise be protected from damage.  All non-magical pathogens in the radius are instantly destroyed and tiny nonmagical plants in the radius that are not creatures wither and die.

Constructs and undead are not affected by this spell.  Additionally, affected creatures with reproductive organs must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a 10 or higher, the creature suffers no further effects.  On a 5 - 9, the creature is sterile for 1 week, then recovers.  Below a 5, the creature is sterile for 1 month and may attempt this saving throw again at the end of the month.

## Teleportation Circle

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute

- **Components**: V, S, M (Rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration**: 1 round
- **Classes**: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

As you cast this spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you.  When you finish the casting of this spell, up to 8 creatures of your choice within range are teleported to the same relative locations at the target location.  If a target space is occupied, a creature is safely shunted to the side.

If you encounter an unfamiliar permanent teleportation circle, you can commit its sigils to memory by studying it for a number of actions equal to 1d20 minus your intelligence modifier (minimum 1).  If you have the Keen Mind feat, merely glancing at the sigils (no action required) is sufficient to commit them to memory.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for a year.

**Higher Levels**: For each slot level above 5th, this spell can target an additional 5 creatures.  Casting the spell at 7th level reduces the time to create a permanent circle to 1 month, and casting this spell at 9th level instantly creates a permanent circle.

## Transmute Rock

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (clay and water)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Wizard

Select one of the following effects and choose a volume of stone within range that fits within the specified cube to subject to that effect.

### Rock to Mud

Nonmagical rock of any sort in a 40-foot cube becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.

The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.

If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Transmute Mud to Rock

Nonmagical mud or quicksand in a 40-foot cube no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points but otherwise possesses the standard properties of stone.

### Flowstone

You cause nonmagical rock in a 40-foot cube to flow like thick syrup, allowing it to move around objects, be directed into a mold, etc.  One minute after casting, the stone slowly hardens, giving creatures the ability to escape it.

### Transmute Rock to Lava

Nonmagical rock or mud in a 5-foot cube is transformed into molten lava.  A creature that begins its turn in the lava's area or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 8d6 fire damage, half on success.  The lava cools after 2d6 hours.

### Transmute Stone to Sand

Nonmagical rock of any type in a 40-foot cube is transmuted to an equivalent volume of sand.  The sand is difficult terrain.

### Transmute Sand to Glass

Nonmagical sand or quicksand that fits within a 40-foot cube and is no more than 10-feet deep is transmuted to clear, polished glass.  Creatures within the volume must make a Dexterity saving throw to be safely shunted to the surface in the nearest unoccupied space.  On a failure, the creature is restrained inside the glass.  A restrained creature may use its action to make a DC20 Strength check with advantage to break the glass.  The glass has AC 12 and 5 hit points and the standard properties of glass.  

When the glass is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, dealing 8d6 slashing damage to any creatures or objects that were trapped within it.

### Transmute Sand to Stone

You transmute an area of sand no more than 10 feet deep in a 40-foot cube into sandstone.   Creatures within the volume must make a Dexterity saving throw to be safely shunted to the surface in the nearest unoccupied space.  On a failure, the creature is restrained inside the sandstone.  A restrained creature may use its action to make a DC15 Strength check to break the stone.  The sandstone has AC 10 and 20 hit points, but otherwise possesses the properties of stone.

## Tree Stride

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Ranger

You gain the ability to enter a Huge or larger living plant (such as s tree or giant mushroom) with a stalk or trunk at least as large as yourself and be conveyed from inside it to inside another plant of the same species within 500 feet by using 5 feet of movement.  As part of that movement, you can choose to exit through your current plant or a target plant.  While inside a plant, you automatically know the location of all other plants of the same species within 500 feet of it.

You may pass through no more than one plant per turn, and must end your turn outside of a plant.

**Higher Levels**: If cast with a spell slot of 7th level or above, this spell does not require concentration.

## Twilight

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a love letter written during an eclipse)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid

You draw energy from the Feywild to burn and inflame the passions of your foes.  A sparkling purple light shines down in a 10-foot radius cylinder that is 40 feet tall that illuminates its area with dim light.  When the cylinder appears, as well as when a creature enters the cylinder for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 4d10 Radiant damage.  Additionally, a creature that fails this save has disadvantage to resist charms until the end of its next turn.  

If you are within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action.

**Higher Levels**: For each slot higher than 5th this is cast with, the damage increases by 1d10.

## Vertigo

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Select up to five creatures you can see within range that can see.  You create undulating figments around them that makes the world seem to twist and bend.  Each target has its speed reduced by 5 until the end of the spell.  Additionally, the targets must make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failure, a creature is sickened.  A creature sickened by this spell falls prone at the beginning of each of its turns and may not take reactions.  A sickened creature repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the sickness on itself on a success.  Ending the sickness does not remove the speed reduction.

Sailors have advantage on saving throws imposed by this spell.

A creature may close its eyes at the beginning of its turn to be treated as blinded until the beginning of its next turn.  Doing so prevents the target from needing to make a saving throw from this spell until then.

## Wall of Stone

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a small block of granite)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Artificer, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is composed of ten [Wall of Stone Panel](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#wall-of-stone-panel)s, allowing you to create a 100 foot wall, or a 200 foot wall. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Destroying a panel might even cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.

## Zenith's Hellstream

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (90-foot line)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a magnesium coin)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

A brilliant orb of blue fire appears in your hand when you cast this spell, casting bright light for 30 feet, and dim light for another 30 feet.  It then erupts in a torrent of flame in the form of a line 15 feet wide and 80 feet long.  Creatures caught in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive 7d6 fire damage.  Flammable objects that are not being worn or carried in the area are instantly ignited.  The fire damage of this spell ignores resistance.

While you maintain concentration on this spell, you may use an action to unleash further gouts of flame.  While concentrating on this spell, you may not hold anything in the hand that holds the orb of fire or use it for somatic components of other spells.

**Higher Levels**: Damage increases by 1d6 for every level above 5th.
