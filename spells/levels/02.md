## Call of Arms

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You conjure three martial weapons your choice that float in the air beside you before streaking toward a target point, creature, or uncontrolled object.  You can select a different target for each weapon.  Make a ranged spell attack for each summoned weapon.  On a hit, regardless of its form, the weapon deals 1d12 magical damage, of a type consistent with the weapon's shape.

Once conjured, the weapons remain for the duration and may be picked up and used by other creatures.  Once picked up, the weapons deal their normal damage, but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level this is cast at above 2nd, another weapon is conjured.  At 4th level, the weapons have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  At 6th, this grows to +2; at 8th, it grows to +3.  These bonuses apply both to the initial spell attack and to any melee weapon attacks made with them thereafter.

## Destabilize

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Bonus Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You summon a ball of chaotic energy and hurl it at a foe to weaken their defenses. Make a ranged spell attack.  On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage and it is marked with destructive magic. If you deal damage to the target creature with a cantrip before the end of your current turn, it takes an additional 2d8 damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level this is cast at above 2nd, the initial and triggered damage both increase by 1d8.

## Detect Thoughts

- **School**: Divination
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (a copper piece)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Wizard

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creatureâ€”what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

**Higher Levels**: If cast with a 3rd level slot, the duration increases to 10 minutes. If cast with a 4th level slot, the duration increases to 1 hour. If cast with a 5th level slot, the duration increases to 4 hours. If cast with a 6th level slot or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours and this spell no longer requires concentration.

## Detect Vitals

- **School**: Divination
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Warlock, Wizard

You grant a creature you touch the ability to see inside other creatures.  For the duration, when the target damages another creature, leaving the victim below one quarter of its health, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw to resist dropping to 0 hit points and begin dying.  The DC is equal to 10 or half the damage dealt (rounded down), whichever is higher.

Additionally, when the target creature makes a ranged or spell attack, it can elect to deal non-lethal damage.

Finally, when the target heals another creature, the healed creature heals for an additional amount equal to the target's proficiency bonus.

You banish the nonmagical dirt or clay in a 5-foot cube you can see, and harden the edges to prevent cave-ins.  While the spell persists, you can use your action to banish another cube within range.

This spell can also target earth elementals, and forces them to make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failure, they take 4d6 force damage, or half as much on a success.

**Higher Levels**: When cast as a 4th level spell or higher, this spell can also dig through unworked nonmagical stone.  When cast as an 8th or 9th level spell, this spell can banish all nonmagical nonliving substances short of adamantine.

## Endless Sword

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: Special
- **Range**: Self (10-foot radius)
- **Components**: M (a melee weapon that deals slashing damage)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 round
- **Classes**: Bard, Warlock, Wizard

On your turn, you can cast this spell, no action required. When you do so, your blade absorbs echoes of the destruction it wreaks until the end of your current turn. On your next turn, you can use your action to release this energy, summoning a storm of ephemeral razors. If you do not release the energy, it fades away, and the spell ends.

When you release the energy, creatures other than you within 10 feet of you must succeed on a constitution saving throw or take slashing damage equal to half the amount of slashing damage you dealt with the material component for this spell since you cast the spell. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage. After releasing the energy, the spell ends.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 2nd this spell is cast at, you can increase the radius by 10 feet.

## Endurance

- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Warlock

You touch a creature and shroud it in reinforcing magic. For the duration, at the start of each of its turns turns if it has at least 1 hit point, the target gains temporary hit points equal to this spell's level and regains half as many hit points. Any remaining temporary hit points are lost when the spell ends.

- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You cause a creature or unrestrained object within range to grow or shrink, which lasts for the duration.  If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw to resist.

- **Enlarge**: The target's size increases by one class, and its weight octuples.  If there isn't enough room for this growth, the target attains the maximum size possible for the available space.  Until the spell ends, the target has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  Additionally, the target's weapons grow to match its new size.  When the creature makes a weapon attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage.
- **Reduce**: The target's size decreases by one class, and its weight shrinks to one-eighth of normal.  Until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  Additionally, the target's weapons shrink to match its new size.  When the creature makes a weapon attack, it deals 1d4 less damage.

**Higher Levels**: For every two spell levels above 2nd this is cast at, the creature's size class increases or decreases by one additional tier, altering its weight appropriately and adding or removing another d4 of damage.

You create a visual glamor that occupies a 20-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range.  A creature that navigates the area by sight finds its path bending and twisting before it.  Any ranged attack passing through, into, or out of the cube is made with disadvantage.  Whenever a creature moves to exit the cube, roll a d4 to determine which side they actually emerge from (1 = North, 2 = East, 3 = South, 4 = West).  If the creature flies, use a d6 instead to account for vertical movement (5 = Down, 6 = Up).  If the face rolled is blocked by an obstacle, the creature moves to that boundary and comes to a stop instead.

If one of you attempts to move farther away, you must make a contested Strength (athletics) check.  If the mover is victorious, they succeed in dragging the other party.

## Parasitic Melody

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action

You sing an annoying jingle that becomes stuck in the head of a target creature that can hear you.  For the duration, when the creature makes concentration checks with disadvantage.

## Phantasmal Force

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fallâ€”it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 2nd this is cast at, this spell can deal an additional 1d6 damage each round.

The GM may require that you describe the point in the past where you acquired the item.

A flurry of magical snowballs erupt from a point you can see within range.  Each creature in a 5-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw.

When you cast the spell, choose a form: Warrior, Mage, or Archer.  The form determines certain traits in their stat block.  Your ancestor disappears when they drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The spirit is an ally to you and your companions.  Their memories of their life are foggy and filled with gaps, but they recall any previous times you have summoned them.  In combat, your ancestor shares your initiative count, but they take their turn immediately after yours.  They obey your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don't issue a command, they will attempt to defend you and your companions to the best of their ability.

**Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

**Higher Levels**: For every two spell levels above 2nd this spell is cast at, the size of the cube increases by 5 feet.

You conjure stained glass wings for yourself that you may briefly use.  As part of this action, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet that replaces your normal movement.

You conjure a ball of water at a point you can see within range and spin it rapidly. You then release your magic, and the orb explodes outward into a thin, high-pressure disk that carves through the space around it. Creatures within 10 feet of the orb must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 4d8 slashing damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 2nd this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d8.

Your eyes turn black and leak dark smoke before and unleash a blast of negative energy toward a target.  If the target is a creature, it can make two Charisma saving throws to resist the beams individually.  For each beam that is not resisted, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 2nd this is cast at, increase the damage of each beam by 1d6.
