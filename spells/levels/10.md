# Level 10

## Apotheosis

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 8 Hours
- **Range**: 10 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (mana crystals containing no less than 10,000 spell points, a legendary magic item, and 10,000,000gp, all of which is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You attempt to raise a creature to divinity, drawing out the magical essence of the material components of this spell and compressing them into a shimmering floating sphere of glowing blue metal.  If you lose concentration on the casting of this spell, it goes awry, with the exact effect varying based upon how far into the process you are.

- 1st Hour: You lose access to 9th level spells until the end of your next long rest.
- 2nd Hour: You also receive 5d20 force damage.
- 3rd Hour: You are shifted random plane of existence.  You can cast no spells until you leave that plane.
- 4th Hour: You permanently lose a point in your spellcasting ability.
- 5th Hour: You permanently lose your 10th level spell slot.
- 6th Hour: You lose the ability to ever use magic again.
- 7th Hour: You become a lich.
- 8th Hour: You die, and your soul is annihilated.

At the completion of the casting of this spell, a floating sphere of molten orichalcum is formed.  The first living creature to make contact with the sphere ascends to divinity as an Underlord and gaining its primary class's Divine Mantle feature.

At the DM's discretion, the campaign then ends.

## Arboreal Army

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Self (1-mile radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: 4 hours
- **Classes**: Druid

You awaken all Large or larger plants of your choice within range that are not already creatures, as if by the _Awaken_ spell, for the duration.  During this time, they are charmed and friendly toward you and your companions.  You can also issue mental commands to them, no action required.

At the end of the duration, the plants return to their original forms, and take root wherever they find themselves.

## Archive

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Reaction, which you take when you witness an event
- **Range**: Unlimited
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard

As a reaction, you turn an event you witness into an incontrovertible fact of reality.  This could be something such as a natural disaster or a creature's death, decision, birth, ability check, saving throw, or attack roll.  In the event of this spell being cast as a reaction to a die roll, it triggers immediately after the rollâ€™s resolution, but before any abilities that disregard the die roll.  For instance, if a creature fails a saving throw, this spell can interdict the activation of Legendary Resistances or the Lucky feat, forcing the creature to fail.

Any attempts (even [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish) and acts of gods) to change history fail if they would prevent an Archived event from occurring.  All creatures who perceive the event cannot have their memories magically altered to forget the event, nor can they forget the event and one minute before and after through any means whatsoever.  Creatures that learn of the event never question its veracity.

Records of the event mysteriously find their way to safety, and direct attempts to destroy them are fraught with difficulty.  For instance, a book recording an Archived event thrown into a fire might refuse to burn, the throw could go wide, the book might immediately fall back out of the fire, it might be saved by a sudden rainstorm that extinguishes the fire, or an animal might suddenly come along and retrieve the book, depositing it elsewhere.

Finally, songs about Archived events get stuck in a listener's head, and performance checks to sing them have advantage.

## Dreamscape

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (300-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pillow filled with phoenix down)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Warlock, Wizard

You surround yourself with an an intense psychic field.  Creatures within the radius when you cast this spell or that enter the radius later must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or treat your spells as Dream Spells.  A creature may make another saving throw at the end of each of its turns, after all other effects take place.

Dream Spells have ordinary effects upon creatures that have succeeded on their saves against this spell.  On creatures that have not yet succeeded, however, Dream Spells are perceived as being cast at 9th level and have effects commensurate with that.  If this causes a spell to deal additional damage, the extra damage is dealt as psychic, but the creature perceives it as the normal type of the spell.  Creatures that are subjected to Dream Spells accept any irregularities that result as real, no matter their absurdity.

## Soul Recall

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 10 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric

You speak the name of a creature or touch its remains.  It is restored to life, and any damage to its soul is repaired.  If the creature's soul has been destroyed, you reconstruct it and remove any curses on it.  Once the soul is whole, if the soul is willing, you resurrect the creature.  If you do not have the remains, a new healthy body in the creature's prime will be created for it.

This spell can also be cast on a living creature who has lost the ability to cast Wish as a means of restoring that faculty.

## Tharizdun's Oblivion

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (the iris of an Astral Dreadnought)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

This spell deletes a volume of space from reality.  You target a point in space you can see within range and reality collapses inward within a 30-foot radius.  Soulless entities are removed from existence by this spell.  Souled creatures within the radius must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or receive 60d6 Force damage, half on success.

After this spell is cast, the volume is unoccupiable as it is _not_.  Creatures may cross instantly from what was once one side of the volume to the other as no distance now exists between them.  Creatures attempting to view an area of reality affected by this spell through use of Truesight will see cracks in reality emanating 30 feet outward from the point where the deleted space used to be.

## Undead Army

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Self (300-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (the skull of a humanoid you personally killed, filled with jewels worth 3000gp, all of which the spell consumes)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Corpses of humanoids within the effect radius rise as Zombies, and skeletons of humanoids rise as Skeletons.  The undead created by this spell are under your control indefinitely.  You may mentally order any subset of them as a bonus action.

## Unmake

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bone from a miscarried fetus)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You attempt to unmake a target creature or object by rewinding time.  The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have its age reduced by 1d4 years.  The target loses all memory of the lost time.  If a creature is reduced to an age of zero, it vanishes from existence.  If this event is Archived, that being is irrevocably erased from reality and cannot be restored by any means, even [Soul Recall](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#soul-recall), [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish), or _Divine Intervention_.

## White Nova

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 2 days
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (powdered gemstones worth 20000gp and a gold sphere worth 10000gp that the spell consumes)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Wizard

Over the course of two days in which you cannot rest, you inscribe runes upon the gold sphere used as a material component and fill the engraved runes the provided gemstone dust.  Into those runes you pour unthinkable power, crafting a Nova Sphere.  Once finished, it can only be destroyed by a Sphere of Annihilation or through its own activation.

Upon this sphere finding itself in the direct path of a fully charged [Arcane Annihilation](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/09.md#arcane-annihilation), it will devours the pillar of energy, negating the spell's normal effects, whereupon the sphere detonates in a tremendous explosion.

### Detonation Effects

The below effects are cumulative.  Creatures have advantage on the saving throws if they are behind full cover, but cover is otherwise ignored.

- Creatures and objects within 20 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 40d10 Necrotic damage, half on success.
- Creatures and objects within 100 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 40d10 Radiant damage, half on success.
- Creatures and objects within 500 feet must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 40d10 fire damage, half on success.
- Creatures and objects within 1000 feet must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 20d10 Thunder damage, half on success.
- Creatures and objects within 1500 feet must make a Dexterity save or receive 20d10 bludgeoning damage from debris, half on success.
- Creatures and objects large and smaller within 2000 feet must succeed on a Strength save or be knocked prone.
- Creatures within one mile with line of sight to the epicenter or that were within 1000 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw or gain two levels of exhaustion.  Every twelve hours, exhausted creatures must make another Constitution save. On a failure, the creature receives 1d10 Necrotic damage and another level of exhaustion.  After three successes, the creature ceases needing to make this saving throw.

## Wish

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast.  By simply speaking aloud, you alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.  The basic uses of this spell which do not risk adverse effects in most cases are as follows:

- Duplicate any other spell of 9th level or lower.  No requirements for that spell are needed, including any costly components.  The spell simply takes effect.
- You create a non-magical object of up to 25,000gp in value.  The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in Greater Restoration.
- You grant up to ten creatures you can see resistance to a damage type of your choice for one week.
- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a particular spell for one week.
- You attempt to rewrite history by forcing a reroll of an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that occurred in the last 24 hours.  This reroll is made with either advantage or disadvantage (caster's choice).  If the reroll succeeds where the original failed or vice versa, reality and history reshape themselves to account for the new result so long as it would not alter an Archived event.

Additional uses of the spell are possible, but are exceptionally dangerous.  The wish may fail, it may be fulfilled in letter but not spirit or an attentive god may intervene, with potentially disastrous results for the caster.  Your DM has wide latitude in interpreting the implementation of the Wish.  If the DM wishes it, Roll a d6.

1. The spell fails and your hit points are reduced by 10d10 that cannot be resisted or regenerated without Divine Intervention and are unable to cast this spell ever again.
2. Your spell takes effect as intended, but a great power in the world becomes hostile toward you.
3. Your spell takes effect in the worst possible way for you.
4. Your spell takes partial effect and you receive 5d10 Necrotic damage that ignores resistances and cannot be regenerated by any means short of divine intervention for 1 week.
5. Your spell is fulfilled in letter, but not spirit.
6. Your spell is fulfilled in spirit.

**Higher Levels**: Should this spell be cast by planar ruler, deity, or if cast using an Orichalcum spellcasting focus, the spell is fulfilled in spirit unless another deity blocks it.  Casting in this way has no adverse effects on the caster.

## Zenith's Starfall

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Sight (5-mile radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

The stars rain down from the heavens in a column on an area you choose within range.  All creatures and uncontrolled objects with nothing above them in the affected area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 7d8 Piercing damage and 7d8 Radiant damage.  Wall of Force, Prismatic Wall, and Perimeter Shield protect entities below them and are themselves immune to this damage.  All other barrier spells are bypassed.

At the start of a creature's turn while in the column or when it first enters it on its turn, it must make another save or receive further damage.

While concentrating on this spell, you are unable to move or take actions on your turn, and you glow a brilliant blue-white, shedding bright light for 30 feet and dim light for another 30 beyond.

For 1d4 days after casting this spell, night skies have no stars, and passage through the crystal sphere is impossible.
