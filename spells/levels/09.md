# Level 9

## Arcane Annihilation

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 1 mile
- **Components**: V, S, M (an object worth at least 1000gp that was damaged by a teleportation mishap)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You point to a spot on the ground you can see, and a thin beam of searing blue light shoots from there into the sky above.  Ten miles up, a blazing star of arcane power appears, providing bright light in a 20 mile radius and dim light for 20 miles beyond.  On each of your following turns, you can use your action to defer the inevitable assault, expanding the radii of the bright and dim lights by 5 miles each time you do so as the star grows larger and brighter.

While charging, this spell cannot be dispelled or neutralized by any means whatsoever.  Even [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish), [Disjunction](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/09.md#disjunction), and _Divine Intervention_ have no effect on this spell.  If you lose concentration, the star remains, but you lose the capacity to delay its activation further.

At the completion of your first turn on which you do not defer the spell, a brilliant pillar of arcane energy screams down upon the target point in a pillar with a 20-foot radius, Non-magical structures in the way are obliterated, and everything else within the pillar receives 2d100 Force damage plus 1d100 for each time you deferred the spell's activation.  Walls of Force and similar magic are dispelled if the pillar passes through them.  Creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this spell are annihilated, as is their soul.  Magical items of quality Rare and below that are within the pillar are also annihilated.

This spell's destructive power burrows into the ground, creating a deep, narrow crater.  Every 20 points of damage allows digging through 5 feet of dirt.  Stone requires 50 points per five feet. Metal requires 70 points per five feet.  This spell boils away water without consuming burrowing distance.  Damage dealt to anything above the target point does not consume burrowing distance.

This spell cannot target a location on a plane that does not extend at least 10 miles above the ground, but it can target spaces inside structures. In such cases, the bolt streaks up through the roof, igniting flammable material along the way.  If you target a point underground with this spell, the spell will instead target the surface above your desired target.

Afterward, plants cannot grow within 100 feet of the crater for the next 2d20 decades.

**Higher Levels**: Initial damage increases by 1d100 when you cast this spell with a 10th level slot.

## Azdregath's Chemical Catastrophe

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 300 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a handful of salt)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You transmute a nonmagical stone object of size huge or smaller or up to a 15-foot cube of a larger nonmagical object into a boiling incandescent puddle of purple ectoplasmic goo. Indigo flames dance on its surface and shed bright light for 10 feet and dim light for 10 feet beyond that.  Every foot of movement through the goo requires three feet of movement.

The area covered by goo varies with the size of the original object.  Small and Tiny objects yield a 5-foot square of coverage.  Medium objects result in a 10-foot square.  Large objects yield 20-foot squares.  Huge objects yield 40-foot squares.

Creatures that begin their turn in the goo or enter it for the first time on their turns receive 7d6 Fire damage, 7d6 Poison damage, and 7d6 Acid damage and are Poisoned until they leave the area.  The damage dealt by this spell ignores resistances.  At the start of each of your turns, the goo eats 5 feet down through any nonmagical dirt, sand, stone, metal, plant matter, or other non-living material it sits upon.  The goo sinks in water, but continues to burn and cannot be quenched by any means, including [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish).

When the spell ends by any means, even if by antimagic, the goo retracts backward and reverts to the original object, pulling any creatures in the area with it.  Creatures in the goo that are smaller than the original object must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be petrified inside the original object, their faces rising out of the material in whatever expression they last held, possibly with arms or hands outstretched.  To restore a creature petrified by this spell, its face must be subjected to anti-petrification magic, and then, it must be broken out by destroying the object around the creature.

## Blade of Disaster

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Bonus Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create a blade-shaped rift in reality in an unoccupied space you can see within range.  The blade lasts for the duration.  When you cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell attacks with the blade, each one against a creature or uncontrolled object within 5 feet of the blade.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage.  This attack has a critical hit range of 3.  On a critical hit, this deals an additional 8d12 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.

The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including shields, armor, Shield, Mage Armor, and Walls of Force, but does not bypass natural armor.

## Cloaked Legion

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Self (1000-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1000gp)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 12 hours
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

A vast, blanketing glamor sweeps out from you, encircling creatures and objects around you.  A number up to 100 times your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 100) of willing creatures or objects no larger than gargantuan that you can see within range turn invisible for the spell’s duration, and Wisdom (survival) checks made to gather information about the cloaked forces are made with disadvantage.  Anything an affected creature wears or carries is also invisible as long as it is on the creature’s person.  You and the targets of the spell can see through this illusion.

The illusion ends early on any creature that attacks or casts a spell.  You can also use a bonus action to end the spell’s effects on any number of targets early, no matter where they are.

This spell cannot target objects being worn or carried by unwilling creatures.

## Crackling Doom

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 1 mile
- **Components**: V, S, M (a shard of glass)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You call down an immense bolt of lightning on a point you are familiar with within range.  Creatures within 40 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 30d6 Lightning damage.  On a successful save, a creature receives only half damage.  This effect bypasses partial and total cover, even when granted by a magical barrier such as Wall of Force or Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere.

## Disjunction

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a beholder's primary eye's iris)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

The Weave is torn apart and rewoven totally flat in a 30-foot radius that follows you.

- All magical effects of 9th level or below are instantly dispelled upon entering this field or the field appearing atop them.  A spell or spell-like effect with an epicenter outside Disjunction's radius that reaches into this spell's radius will have its normal effect outside, but no effect inside.  If a ranged spell attack attempts to pass through the field, it is dispelled.  If a spell must travel through the field to cause an effect beyond it, it is dispelled.
- Magic items that are not made of Orichalcum are instantly and permanently rendered mundane.  Enchantments on Orichalcum items are suppressed outside themselves, but continue to function on themselves.  For example, a magical sword made of Orichalcum with the ability to coat its blade in flame would remain magical, but would lose the ability to coat itself in flame.
- Creatures that rely on magic for survival such as Celestials, Constructs, Fey, Fiends, and Undead begin to die.  Each round such a creature spends within this radius, it must make a Constitution saving throw at the beginning of its turn or permanently loses HP equal to the size of its hit dice.  When all hit dice are lost, the creature dies.  Vestiges, Liches, Empyreans, Solars, Pit Fiends, Balors, Modron Hierarchs, and Esalak have advantage on these saving throws.
- Sapient magical constructs not made of Orichalcum are instantly rendered unconscious and must begin making death saving throws.  If they succeed, they are rendered comatose for 1d4 weeks.
- If a deity's avatar enters the radius, the spell instantly ends and the caster takes 20d20 Force damage.

## Earthglide

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Druid

You speak the name of a location and sink into whatever surface you are standing on.  Anything you are wearing or carrying, as well as up to one willing creature of your size or smaller that you are touching and anything it is wearing or carrying travels with you.

You can be specific or general with your description.  For example, you could say "the nearest swamp" or "5 feet behind Raogon Duskfire's throne."  If there is a contiguous path of earth, plants, and stone between yourself and the target, over the next hour, your discorporated essence is conveyed toward the destination.  During this time, you and your passenger are incapacitated and have resistance to all damage.  At the end of the spell’s duration, you emerge from the ground at the target location.

If no such path exists, the destination does not exist, or if the substance through which you are traveling is destroyed, the spell immediately ends, you and your companion are ejected at the nearest open space, and receive 4d10 force damage.

## Immortal Army

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Self (50-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 15000gp)
- **Duration**: 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

You release a burst of divine power that can restore entire legions to life.  Select any number of corpses within range.  If the corpses have been dead for no longer than 1 hour and their souls are willing and able, the creatures are restored to life with 1 hit point, and at the start of each of their turns, if a creature has at least 1 hit point, it regenerates 1 hit point.

## False Identity

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a blank sheet of paper)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You blanket a target creature with an intelligence of 6 or more that you can see within range with a potent shadow glamor.  The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be stunned for the duration.  The stunned creature is unaware of its surroundings.  If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell in this time, this spell ends.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, you weave the glamor into a new identity for the creature, which is permanent and cannot be dispelled.  The creature loses all memory of its former self, and you can choose to remove any or all of the creature’s proficiencies and class features, if it has any.  You can also reduce any of the creature’s mental scores of your choice, to a minimum of 8.

You decide the new identity’s past and personality, creating memories, beliefs, and desires as you choose, but you cannot change the creature’s alignment.  The creature’s mind fills in any gaps in its story and rationalizes any inconsistencies.  If a creature’s alignment conflicts with its new identity, it justifies it as best it can and dismisses it as a sense of unease or discomfort.

You can also weave the shadow glamor into a new appearance.  You decide the creature’s new appearance, which must be the same size class and must have the same arrangement of limbs.

A _Greater Restoration_, _Heal_, or [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish) spell cast on the target can restore the creature’s true identity.

## Gate

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5000gp)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a plane of existence of your choice. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 40 feet in diameter. You can orient the portals in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.

The portals have a front and a back on each plane where they appear. The front looks to be a rippling pool and the back looks to be made of gold. Travel through the portals is possible only by moving through their fronts. Anything, including spell effects (such as the pillar of Arcane Annihilation) that does so is instantly transported to the other portal, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

## Judgment

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Sight
- **Components**: V, S, M (a golden scale worth at least 1000gp)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You pass judgment on a creature on behalf of your deity. Select one of the following options.  These effects count as direct divine action for the purpose of overcoming other effects.

- **Absolution**: The target is cleared of any charms or other mind-altering effects of your choice, and then becomes aware of all magical effects upon itself and may immediately remove any effects of its choice.
Condemn: Select up to three effects from Bestow Curse. The creature is now cursed in those ways for one minute.  Alternatively, you may apply a single curse until dispelled.
- **Excommunicate**: If the creature worships the same deity you do and has at least one, but fewer levels in Paladin, Cleric, and/or Warlock associated with it, it is stripped of all class features from those levels, but retains ability score increases, feats, and health.  If the target can strike a deal with a new patron or god within a month, the target permanently loses two of the levels, but the rest are transferred to the new patron.
- **Mercy**: You restore 70 hp to the target. Any excess healing becomes temporary hit points that last until the end of the creature's next short or long rest.
Penance: You set an objective for a creature and Curse it to fulfill it.  If the creature does not fulfill the objective within one year, it is Vanquished, as if by this spell or has one of the effects of Bestow Curse permanently applied to it, the very fabric of its being changing to make this effect removable only through direct divine action or through Wish.
- **Vanquish**: a pillar of energy streams down from the sky onto the creature, compelling a Constitution saving throw.  On a failure, a creature receives 20d12 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice); a creature receives half on success.

**Higher Levels**: At 10th level, Absolution affects tenth level magic, Condemn can apply four temporary curses, Mercy can restore 80 hit points, and Vanquish deals an additional 5d12.

## Perimeter Shield

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Touch (1-mile radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a sunstone worth at least 5000gp)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You weave together a colossal domed shield covered in translucent blue triangular panels that grants total cover.  Once this spell is complete, nothing may pass from one side of the shield to the other except harmless levels of light and sound, allowing communication through the barrier.  Telepathy is possible from one side of the barrier to the other, but translocation via anything less than a Gate spell is not.  

Each 10-foot-base triangular panel of the shield has 40 hit points and regenerates 10 hit points per round as long as it survives.  If a panel has all its hit points and its adjacent panel has been destroyed, on initiative count 0, it will donate half its health to restore its neighbor to half health.  While a panel is destroyed, creatures, objects, and spell effects may pass through the hole, but translocation cannot.  If 400 or more triangles are destroyed at any given time, the shield breaks and the spell ends.

Higher Levels: When cast at 10th level, the hexagons become immune to nonmagical weapons, magic of first level, and first grade cantrips.  Additionally, the shield does not break unless 600 panels are destroyed.

## Phantom Army

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 10 Minutes
- **Range**: Sight
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 8 hours
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

Select three points within range.  You craft a shadow figment of every willing creature within 50 feet of each point.  These figments take their turns immediately after yours and follow your mental commands (no action required by you) as long as you are on the same plane of existence.  They have all the ability scores and traits of the original creatures, but cannot deal damage or impose status effects on other creatures, although they still count as hostile creatures for features such as Sneak Attack and Flanking until they have been revealed as illusions.  Each figment has half the hit points of the original creature.  The figments are indistinguishable from the original creatures until they make an effort to deal damage or receive melee damage themselves.

The figments created by this spell are not detectable as such by spells such as Detect Magic, though Truesight will still reveal their nature.

## Power Word Kill

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You attempt to sever a target creature's link between body and soul.  If the creature has 150 or fewer hit points, it dies.

**Higher Levels**: At tenth level, the threshold increases to 200 hit points.

## Primordial Wrath

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 1 mile
- **Components**: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid

A chasm 30 feet wide, 100 feet long, and 100 feet deep rips open before you, oriented as you wish, dropping creatures and structures into a roiling lake of lava.  Any creatures in the area may attempt a Dexterity saving throw to hold onto the ground as it splits open, shunting them to the side of the chasm on a success.

Creatures that fall into the lava take the normal damage for both (10d6 fall damage, and 18d10 fire damage for submersion in lava).

**Higher Levels**: When cast at tenth level, the turn after casting this, as an action, you can close the chasm, sealing any fallen creatures inside a lava pocket.

## Pyroclasm

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Sight
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You summon an immense whirlwind of fire and ash that incinerates its surroundings.  When you cast this spell, select a point on the ground you can see.  A whirlwind of flame and ash spins up in a cylinder around it, 30 feet in radius and 150 feet tall.  The area is heavily obscured and creatures are deafened while they are in the area.

Each creature that begins its turn inside the tornado of fire or moves into it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 32d6 fire damage, half on success.  Objects that are not worn or carried, structures, and plants receive maximized damage from this spell.  Creatures reduced to zero hit points by this spell are slain and their corpses are petrified in hardened ash.  Flammable objects burned by this spell that are not destroyed outright are ignited.

At the start of each of your successive turns, the radius and height of the whirlwind double and any damage dealt that round is successively halved, as shown in the table below.

| Turn | Damage (fire) | Radius (ft) |  Height (ft) |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| 1    | 32d6          | 30          | 150          |
| 2    | 16d6          | 60          | 300          |
| 3    | 8d6           | 120         | 600          |
| 4    | 4d6           | 240         | 1200         |
| 5    | 2d6           | 480         | 2400         |
| 6    | 1d6           | 960         | 4800         |
| 7    | 0             | 1920        | 9600         |
| 8    | 0             | 3840        | 19200        |
| 9    | 0             | 7680        | 38400        |
| 10   | 0             | 15360       | 76800        |

The whirlwind of fire sheds bright light for 3 miles and dim light for 3 miles beyond for as long as it continues to deal damage.  Once the spell has expanded to the point it no longer deals damage, the whirlwind of ash continues to heavily obscure and deafen creatures in its area for the duration.

## Raogon's Skygrasp

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (100-mile radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a sunstone worth at least 1200gp)
- **Duration**: 8 hours
- **Classes**: Wizard

You gain control over the appearance of naturally occuring heavenly bodies in the sky for the duration.  You do not actually move the location of these bodies, only their apparent location as perceived by those creatures inside the radius.  Light projected from these false bodies still counts as true light from those bodies.  Below are examples of uses of this spell on the prime material plane, though they are not exhaustive.

For the duration, as an action, you can make any further alterations of your choice to the illusion.

- **Day to Night**: instantly remove solar illumination in the radius
- **Night to Day**: instantly add solar illumination to continue a battle or cripple a vampire.
- **Full Moon**: display the moon as full, even in daytime, thereby triggering lycanthrope transformations.
- **New Moon**: remove a full moon from the sky
- **Meteor Shower**: you cannot use this to actually rain down meteors on the landscape, but you can create beautiful displays in the sky visible to those in the radius.
- **Planet Alignments**: you can make planets appear to be in locations other than where they truly are.
- **Constellations**: you can arrange the appearance of the stars to display images and text.

## Realm Lock

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 8 hours
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: S, M (a diamond worth at least 10000gp and up to 10 other gems worth at least 500gp each)
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Classes**: Wizard

You cast this spell on the gems provided for it and speak two words.  The first becomes the activation word, the second becomes the deactivation word.  If you later speak the words in the presence of the primary diamond, the effects of this spell activate or deactivate respectively.  While active, teleportation or portals within fifty miles of any diamond used as a material component for this spell is impossible and such spells that are attempted immediately fail during casting.  Use of magesight while the effect is active reveals waves of abjuration magic radiating in great waves from the lesser gems and massive, but discrete packets of abjuration magic heading toward the lesser gems from the primary diamond.

To dispel the effect, the central diamond must be targeted with antimagic or shattered.  Placing a lesser gem in an antimagic field causes it to have its normal effects outside the field.  If a lesser gem is shattered, it ceases to function, but all others remain.

All efforts to shift the diamonds used for this spell to different planes of existence fail.

## Skycastle

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 8 hours
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (25000gp worth of diamond dust, which the spell consumes; and a richly-appointed seat worth at least 5000gp)
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Classes**: Wizard

While casting, you sprinkle the dust around the perimeter of a circle with a radius of no more than 2,000 feet that contains one or more buildings.  You must then cast the spell while sitting on the seating component throughout the entire casting.

Upon completion, all inanimate material within the radius breaks free of material outside the radius.  Within a spherical volume with the original diamond dust radius, gravity points toward the nearest side of the plane on which the diamond dust was scattered, translated for its current location and orientation.

While sitting in the chair, you can change the orientation of the skycastle (up to 11.25 degrees per round) and fly it up to 100 feet per round.  Objects within the gravitational radius do not feel these shifts.  The skycastle may not fly more than 1 mile above the surface of Faerun (i.e. 1 mile above sea level if over the ocean or 5 miles above sea level if flying over a mountain with a peak of 4 miles above sea level).

As a bonus action while touching the throne, you may stipulate the creature presently sitting on the throne as an alternate pilot.

To dispel this effect, the throne itself must be subjected to sufficiently powerful antimagic.  If the dispel is successful, the castle safely descends at a rate of 100 feet per round for one minute with its gravity field intact.  If it has not landed in that time, it plummets the rest of the way at 500 feet per round.  Creatures and objects beneath the castle when it plummets in this way receive 20d20 bludgeoning damage for every 100 feet it falls.

## Sonic Boom

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You lurch forward in a direction of your choice and immediately travel up to 1000 feet to a point you can see.  This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and does not trigger readied actions targeting you, but any hazards between you and your destination otherwise apply as normal.  If you collide with an invisible solid object in your path such as a Wall of Force, you die and your body is destroyed, rendered into fine paste.

From your destination point, you create a tremendous shockwave of energy that propagates backwards toward your starting point as a cone with a length equal to the distance traveled.  Creatures and objects that are not worn or carried within the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 20d6 thunder damage, or half on a success.  This deals double damage to structures.  Success or failure, creatures within the cone are deafened.

## Time Stop

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

When you cast this spell, you can choose to alter the flow of time in one of two ways:

- **Full Stop**: You halt the flow of time for all creatures other than yourself.  This effect ends early if you or any effects you create during this period affect a creature other than you or an object that is controlled by someone other than you.
- **Matter Stop**: You halt the flow of time for all physical matter, but you exempt the minds of all creatures within 1 mile of you.  During this time, all affected creatures gain a telepathy range of 2 miles and can communicate freely.  As the caster, you have the ability to broadcast a message to any or all of the affected creatures simultaneously.

## Transform Terrain

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute
- **Range**: Self (200-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid

You alter the terrain surrounding you into any natural form you desire and can remove or add non-magical plants and beasts while you do so.  This spell cannot be used within 300 feet of a hostile sapient being's structure.  The following are a few examples of what can be done with this spell.

- Make a mountain spring up, covered in trees
- Turn a desert into an oasis
- Level a mountain.
- Raise the ocean floor to create an island
- Form a canyon, filled with lava

## True Creation

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You create an object worth 5,000gp or less that fits within a 5-foot cube.  Complex objects may require skill checks to successfully create.  Objects created by this spell can be dispelled and cannot be used as spell components.

If this spell is used to create a magic item, the DM secretly rolls 1d4.  On a 1, the item is cursed.

**Higher Levels**: At 10th level, the item becomes real and cannot be dispelled and can be used as a spellcasting component.

## True Polymorph

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. Creatures produced by this spell can be of a novel species, but the DM may ask for a check, with failures potentially leading to uncontrollable monstrosities.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation becomes permanent.

Shapechangers aren't affected by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn't affected by this spell.  This spell can't affect a target that has 0 hit points.

### Creature into Creature

If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or its level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
     The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
     The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless its new form is capable of such actions.
     The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

### Object into Creature

You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is no larger than the object's size and the creature's challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature's statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

### Creature into Object

If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature's statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.  If a spell attempts to use the object as a valuable material component, the spell fails.  The object cannot be of a size class larger than the creature.  If the resulting object is a magic item, it cannot have a rarity above the thresholds defined below and the item inherits the alignment and personality of the creature, can communicate telepathically with a creature in contact with it or attuned to it.

- **Common**: any challenge rating.
- **Uncommon**: CR1+
- **Rare**: CR10+
- **Very Rare**: 20+
- **Legendary**: 25+
- **Divine**: CR30

**Higher Levels**: At 10th level, when making the effect permanent, the magic reshapes the target's true being into the new form and then the magic of the spell fades, leaving the target permanently in the desired form.  At that point, attempts to dispel the effect are impossible and attempts to detect the magic of this spell on the target fail.  Additionally, the target once more becomes a valid target for this spell.

## Weird

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Warlock, Wizard

You craft an eldritch unknowable symbol on the inside surface of a 30-foot-radius dome centered on a point you can see within range.  Any creature that sees the symbol must make a Constitution saving throw.

- **On a success**, the creature receives 4d10 Psychic damage and the spell ends for that creature.  
- **On a failure**, the symbol, known as The Weird, penetrates the creature’s mind and the creature must then make a Charisma saving throw as the knowledge begins to tear its identity apart.  A creature can willingly fail this save.
  - **On a success**, the creature is Paralyzed until the end of its next turn and loses the ability to benefit from short rests or to feel emotions.  It regains these abilities at the end of its next long rest.
  - **On a failure**, the creature receives Psychic damage equal to its maximum hit points.  If the creature survives this damage, it has a brief flash of insight into the deeper truths of the universe.  Until the end of its next turn, the creature has advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and attacks against the creature have disadvantage.

If this spell reduces a creature to zero hit points, the creature dies.  If the caster wills it, it rises as an _Allip_ π days later unless efforts are taken to cleanse or burn the body beforehand or it is resurrected before then.
