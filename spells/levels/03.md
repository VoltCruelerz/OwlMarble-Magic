- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a flask of vinegar)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You create a downpour of acidic rain upon everything in a 40-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range, dealing 3d8 acid damage.  A creature can make a Constitution saving throw to take half damage instead.

## Bestow Curse

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Wizard

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

- Choose one ability score.  The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- The target is in pain.  It has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.
- The target exudes an aura of antipathy, causing other creatures to take its words in the worst light. It gains disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception checks.
- The creature is Deafened or Blinded (your choice).
- The target develops an obviously supernatural (and often ironic) physical trait such as a pig's nose or rat's teeth. It gains disadvantage on persuasion and deception.
- The target becomes gruesomely hideous, causing all creatures that it speaks to but is not in combat with other than any you wish to exempt to be compelled to make a Wisdom save against your Spell Save DC or become frightened for one round.
- The creature becomes insatiably hungry or thirsty. Whenever ingestible substances are present, it must make a Wisdom save or spend its action doing nothing but consuming it.
- You cause the creature to become adverse to a substance of your choice.  When presented with the substance within five feet, it must make a Constitution save or become incapacitated by vomiting and dry heaves for 1 round.
- You switch a creature's sex.  This has no effect on creatures that do not possess them.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- The creature can only speak in incomprehensible gibberish.  It can still cast spells with a Verbal component, however.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- The creature gains all physical traits of a zombie of its species but keeps its mental scores.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- The creature gains a withering touch. Any living thing it touches but does not intend to harm receives 1d10 Necrotic damage.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- Your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.
- The creature suffers vivid hallucinations of their most respected ally condemning them.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- Whenever someone the cursed target knows dies, the target is made fully aware of the ways they could have saved them.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- Whatever physical feature a creature is most insecure about becomes exaggerated. For instance, a short man who is insecure about it shrinks by six inches.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- Food turns to ash in the creature's mouth, requiring them to eat twice as much to maintain weight and they become unable to enjoy eating.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- Whenever a creature attempts to communicate using words or text, it must rhyme or make a Charisma saving throw or receive 1 point of Psychic damage.  This effect's duration is as if the spell was upcast by two levels.
- The creature is afflicted with a long term insanity of your choice.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- The creature has -1 to all d20 rolls.
- The target suffers vivid nightmares that force it to sleep an additional two hours a night to receive a full rest.  This has no effect on creatures that do not sleep.  This effect's duration is as if the spell were upcast by two levels.
- You deface a creature or medium or smaller art object.  A creature or artistic depiction affected by this spell appears to have no face, only smooth skin, though this is merely an illusion.  This effect lasts as if upcast by two levels.
- Whenever the creature hears a word or phrase of your choice, it instead hears the speaker say a different word or phrase. This effect lasts as if upcast by two levels.
- The target loses the benefits of attuning to magic items, including any it has already attuned, and is unable to attune or unattune items, but is still subject to any curses from those items.

A _Remove Curse_ spell cast at the same level or higher ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
The DM has final say on the curse's effect.

**Higher Levels**: At 4th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes with concentration.  At 5th level, it is 8 hours without concentration.  At 7th, it is 24 hours.  At 8th, it is 1 month.  At 9th, it is until dispelled.

## Bind

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a silk ribbon worth at least 2gp, which is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid, Wizard

You grasp a Huge or smaller creature and attempt to bind it. Unless the creature is willing, it must have 5 or fewer hit points or this spell fails instantly.
Circular binding rings appear around the target's appendages and mouth. Its speed is reduced to 10, it cannot fly without the _Hover_ feature, it cannot Dash, any attacks it makes are considered improvised, and it cannot speak.  As an action, the caster can lift one of these restrictions or reinstate it.

**Higher Levels**: At 5th level, duration increases to 1 week and the target gains the liftable restriction of being unable to move more than 60 feet away from the caster. At 7th, it increases to one month and the target gains the liftable restriction of being unable to regain hit points.  At 9th, it increases to 1 year and the restrictions can be lifted or restored as a bonus action by the caster.

## Counterspell

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Reaction, which you take when you observe a creature you can see casting a spell
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

If you wish, before initiating the casting of this spell, you may make an Intelligence (arcana) check contested by the target's Dexterity (sleight of hand).  If you succeed and the spell is on your class's list and is of a level you can cast, you learn the spell's identity and what level it is cast at.  If it is not, but you succeed on the check, you learn the spell's type (arcane, divine, or natural), level, and school.

Regardless of the success or failure of the check, you may then cast this spell to attempt to disrupt the magic before it can affect the world.  If the spell is of the level [Counterspell](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/03.md#counterspell) was cast at or lower, the target's fledgling spell immediately fails.  Otherwise, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability where the DC is 13 plus the difference in level between the two spells.  If you succeed on the check, the target's spell immediately fails.  Otherwise, the spell proceeds as normal.

## Deforest

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a miniature golden axe worth 20gp)

All unintelligent nonmagical immobile plants within range are transformed into grass.

## Dispel Magic

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Choose any creature, object, or magical effect within range. A spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends (if multiple are present and you have used Identify or Detect Magic's focus action, you may select which you target). For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.  When non-spell magical effects are targeted directly, the DC is equal to half the CR of the creature that created it at the time of creation.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.  If not, the DC is reduced by 1 for each spell slot level up this is cast at.

## Downdraft

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 1000 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bird carved out of wood with rubies for eyes worth 10gp that you crush underfoot while casting the spell)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Wizard

You target a flying creature within range and summon a tremendous blast of air down upon it.  The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failure, it plummets 100 feet.  On a success, it falls only 50 feet.  If it strikes the ground, it takes falling damage (1d6 for each 10 feet fallen) plus another 5d6 damage due to the force of the blast, half on success.

## Emerald Crossfire

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (an emerald worth at least 200gp)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Select two points you can see within range that are no more than 40 feet away from each other and create a green flash of light at each as a barrage of emerald-green bolts of necrotic energy fly between them in a 5-foot wide line.  Creatures in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw for half or receive 8d6 points of necrotic damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each level higher, damage increases by 1d6.

## Erupting Earth

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range.  A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20 foot cube centered on that point.  Creatures within the cube must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  Additionally, all creatures with Tremorsense within the target cube or the 20-foot cube directly below it must make a Constitution save or have that sense blinded.  A tremor-blind creature may repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Clearing the difficult terrain requires 1 minute per 5-foot square.

**Higher Levels**: This spell deals an additional 1d12 for each spell level it is cast at above 3rd.

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (an hourglass)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

You encase a creature in ice, restraining it and preventing it from casting spells with somatic components or making weapon attacks.  An unwilling creature may attempt to make a Strength saving throw and then again on each of its turns as an action to attempt to break out, ending the spell on a success.  On a failed saving throw, it receives 2d10 cold damage.  While a creature continues to be restrained, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Upon taking fire damage, the spell ends early, and the creature is freed.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d10 for each spell level above 3rd.

## Ghostfire

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Warlock, Sorcerer, Wizard

Blue flames surge around you in a 20 foot radius that spreads around corners.  A creature other than you that enters the flames for the first time on its turn or begins its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive 4d8 fire damage, half on success.  A creature that fails is outlined in the flames until the end of its next turn or it finds itself outside the area.  During this time, it gains no benefits from being invisible and attacks against it have advantage.

**Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d8 for each spell level above 3rd.

## Hypothermia

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

You deeply chill a target creature and compel a Constitution saving throw.  On a failure, a creature receives 4d10 Cold damage, or half as much on a success.  For every 20 points of damage a creature takes from this spell, they suffer one level of exhaustion that lasts for the spell's duration. If the creature receives fire damage, the spell ends.  Creatures with the _Heated Body_ feature or under the influence of the _Fire Shield_ spell or similar magic are immune to it.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d10.

## Major Figment

_replaces Major Image_

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create a figment that is no larger than a 20-foot cube.  The figment appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, taste, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a taste or smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the figment, you can use your action to cause it to move to any other spot within range. As the figment changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the figment. For example, if you create a figment of a creature and move it, you can alter the figment so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your Concentration.

## Rebound

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Reaction, which you take when you see a creature other than yourself make a weapon attack that affects a creature within range of this spell
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

If the triggering attack hits, the attack deals an additional 3d12 Force damage.  This damage is not doubled by critical hits.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 3rd this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d12.

## Materialize

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (the physical remains of an incorporeal undead)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

Select an incorporeal creature within range, such as a ghost or a creature affected by the _Incorporealness_ spell.  The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or receive 2d8 psychic damage and become manifest, losing its Incorporeal trait, any resistance or immunity to nonmagical weapons, and its fly speed.

Alternatively, you can cast this spell using the physical remains of an incorporeal undead creature, targeting the undead, even if it is outside the spell's range.  If the undead fails its saving throw and is within 1 mile, it is also summoned to a random unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

## Melf's Minute Meteors

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create six tiny meteors in your space.  They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration.  When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter, you can expend up to two meteors, sending them streaking toward one or more points within 120 feet of you.  Once it reaches its destination or impacts a solid surface, the meteor explodes.  Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw.  A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save and half as much if successful.  After detonation, an orb of light hangs in the air for one minute, providing bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for 10 feet beyond.

While the spell is maintained, you can use your reaction to intercept a non-spell projectile attack by expending one of the meteors.  The two will meet at the halfway point between the attacker and you, whereupon the meteor will detonate as normal and damage the projectile and possibly harming other nearby entities.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 3rd that this spell is cast at, two more meteors are generated.  Additionally, for each level above 3, as part of the spell's bonus action behavior, you can send an additional meteor.

## Mindburn

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a scorched quarts crystal)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You compel a target to make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability score.  On a failure, the creature loses a spell slot of its highest level, as if it had expended it, and takes 1d4 psychic damage for each level of the lost spell.

## Phantom Steed

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute Ritual
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Wizard

You create a shadow figment of a riding horse on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

## Pulse

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

You gain tremorsense to a distance of 30 feet for the duration of this spell. Additionally, when you first cast it, as the somatic component, you touch a creature or object, and loose a pulse of energy that causes it to vibrate, as well as any other objects or creatures it touches, any objects or creatures they touch, and so on, out to the range of the tremorsense granted by this spell.  The pulse is strong enough to detect the presence of solids and liquids, but not gases.

Creatures with tremorsense other than you within the range of the spell will gain the same information you do from this pulse.

**Higher Levels**: The radius of the tremorsense increases at higher spell slot levels. At 4th, the range becomes 50 feet. At 5th, 80. 6th, 150. 7th, 500. 8th, 1000. At 9th level, the radius increases to one mile.

## Sending

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Unlimited
- **Components**: V, S, M (a short copper wire)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are moderately familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately as part of this spell. The magic of the spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence.  If the target is on a different plane than you, the DM secretly rolls a d20.  On a 1, the message is not delivered.  If it is delivered and the creature replies, the DM then rolls another d20 to see if you receive the reply.

Messaging a god is likely to inspire divine wrath, earn no response at all, or result in a reply of incomprehensible concepts beyond the caster's understanding.

If you send the message to yourself or someone who is dead, the spell fails.  If the creature is asleep, the message is delivered when the creature awakens.

The following are examples of familiarity that would enable the casting of this spell:

- Someone you have seen the likeness of and know the full name of. Titles and nicknames do not count.
- Someone you have spoken with in person.
- Someone who has previously cast this spell on you.
- Someone with whom you have had written correspondence.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell level higher this is cast at, the word count increases by 5 words.

## Soul Lance

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (90-foot line)
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You unleash a beam of negative energy in a 90-foot line that rips apart the soul chrysalises of any creatures in its path, absorbing their energy to empower itself.

Each creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or receive 4d8 necrotic damage plus the accumulated damage, or half as much on a success.  The accumulated damage is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier multipled by the number of other creatures the beam passed through before affecting the current target.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 3rd this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d8.

## Spectacular Mane

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pecious gemstone worth at least 150gp of the corresponding type)
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard

You touch a creature and its hair or fur becomes invested with one of the following elements.  The creature's hair changes in appearance to display the element.  Short hair such as arm hair may have a lesser effect such as glowing with an inner fire while longer hair such as a beard may become a roaring flame or flowing locks of lightning.

- **Fire (ruby)**: The creature gains resistance to fire damage.  As a bonus action, it can cause this fire to surge, deal 3 points of fire damage to all other creatures within 5 feet of it and igniting them, dealing this damage again at the end of the damaged creature's turn.  A creature can extinguish itself as an action.
- **Ice (diamond)**: The creature gains resistance to cold damage.  Ice creeps outward from the creature's feet.  A creature that ends its turn standing within 5 feet and on the same plane as the ice-invested creature receives 3 points of cold damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have its feet frozen to the ground, reducing its speed to zero.  A creature may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.
- **Lightning (sapphire)**: The creature gains resistance to lightning damage.  As a bonus action, the invested creature may hurl a bolt of lightning at a creature within 15 feet of it.  The targeted creature receives 3 points of lightning damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn.
- **Acid (amethyst)**: The creature gains resistance to acid damage.  When the creature is damaged by a melee attack, its attacker receives 3 points of acid damage.
- **Earth (onyx)**: The creature gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.  As a bonus action, the creature may cause a stone spike to grow out of a space on the ground within 5 feet of it.  The square becomes difficult terrain until the beginning of the invested creature's next turn and any creatures in that space receive 3 points of piercing damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell slot level higher than 3rd this is cast with, damage dealt by this spell increases by 3.

## Springstone

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Hour Ritual
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S, M (sap from a rubber tree)
- **Duration**: 1 year

- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a gilded flower worth at least 300gp)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes**: Druid

You call forth a plant spirit.  The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.  This corporeal form uses the Herbal Spirit stat block.  When you cast the spell, choose a form: _Spore_, _Vine_, or _Fungus_, which determines details of stat block.  The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration.  In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.  It obeys verbal commands you issue (no action required).  If you don’t issue any, it defends itself, but otherwise takes no action.  The spirit is said to have a number of hit dice equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, although it cannot use them to heal.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature’s statistics change to reflect this.

You summon a large shard of ice and propel it at breakneck speed toward a target you can see within range.  Make a ranged spell attack.  On a hit, the target takes 2d10 piercing damage and the shard explodes in a 15-foot cone.  Creatures in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive 4d10 cold damage.  The creature that was hit automatically fails.

You launch a torrential stream of water in a line 10 feet wide and 50 feet long.  The water persists after the spell.  The line must either start from your hand or from a body of water within 30 feet of you.  If the jet originates from your hand, you draw the water from the Plane of Water.  If the spell draws from a body of water, it consumes up to 30,000 gallons of water.

Creatures within the line must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and receive 4d8 bludgeoning damage.  A creature that succeeds on its saving throw receives half as much damage, and is not not knocked prone.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level this is cast at above 3rd, this spell deals an additional 1d8 damage.
