- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You create a shower of caustic acidic rain upon everything in a 40-foot cube centered on a point you can see within range, dealing 3d8 acid damage.  A creature can make a Constitution saving throw to take half damage instead.

## Bestow Curse

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action

- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Cleric, Wizard

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

- Choose one ability score.  The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- The target suffers debilitating pain.  It has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.
- The creature is Deafened or Blinded (your choice).
- The target becomes gruesomely hideous, causing all creatures that it speaks to but is not in combat with to be compelled to make a Wisdom save against your Spell Save DC or become frightened for one round.  When you choose this effect, you can exempt any number of creatures of your choice from the saving throw.
- The creature becomes insatiably hungry or thirsty. Whenever ingestible substances are present, it must make a Wisdom save or spend its action doing nothing but consuming it.
- You cause the creature to become adverse to a substance of your choice.  When presented with the substance within five feet, it must make a Constitution save or become incapacitated by vomiting and dry heaves for 1 round.
- The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- The target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- Your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.
- The creature has -1 penalty to all d20 rolls.
- Whenever the creature hears a word or phrase of your choice, it instead hears the speaker say a different word or phrase with an inflection of your choice. This effect lasts as if upcast by two levels.
- The target loses the ability attune or unattune magical items.

Alternatively, you can select one of the following options, which have a duration as if cast 2 levels higher.  These options do not require concentration:

- The target exudes an aura of antipathy, causing other creatures to take its words in the worst possible light. It gains disadvantage on Persuasion and Deception checks.  When the target is affected, you can choose to also alter their appearance in an obviously supernatural and harmless manner, such as a giving them a pig's nose or a rat's teeth.
- You switch a creature's sex.  This has no effect on creatures that do not possess them or are hermaphroditic.
- The creature can only speak in incomprehensible gibberish, but it can still cast spells with a Verbal component.
- The creature gains all physical traits of a zombie of its species but keeps its mental ability scores, personality, and alignment.
- The creature gains a withering touch. Any living thing it touches receives 1 point of necrotic damage.  A creature may not suffer this damage more than once per round.
- The creature suffers vivid hallucinations of their most respected ally condemning them.
- Whenever someone the cursed target knows dies, the target is made fully aware of the ways they could have saved them.
- Whatever physical feature a creature is most insecure about becomes exaggerated. For instance, a short man who is insecure about it shrinks by six inches.
- Food turns to ash in the creature's mouth, requiring them to eat twice as much to maintain weight and they become unable to enjoy eating.
- Whenever a creature attempts to communicate using words or text, it must rhyme or make a Charisma saving throw or receive 1 point of Psychic damage.  This effect's duration is as if the spell was upcast by two levels.
- The creature is afflicted with a long term insanity of your choice.
- The target suffers vivid nightmares that force it to sleep an additional two hours a night to receive a full rest.  This has no effect on creatures that do not sleep.


A _Remove Curse_ spell cast at the same level or higher ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.
The DM has final say on the curse's effect.

**Higher Levels**: At 4th level, the duration increases to 10 minutes with concentration.  At 5th level, it is 8 hours without concentration.  At 7th, it is 24 hours.  At 8th, it is 1 month.  At 9th, the curse becomes permanent.

## Bind

- **Duration**: 3 days

You grasp a Huge or smaller creature and attempt to bind it. Unless the creature is willing, it must have 5 or fewer hit points or this spell fails.

Circular binding rings appear around the target's appendages and mouth. Its speed is reduced to 10 feet, it cannot fly without the _Hover_ feature, it cannot Dash, any attacks it makes are considered improvised, and it cannot speak.  As an action, the caster can lift one of these restrictions or reinstate it.

**Higher Levels**: At 5th level, duration increases to 1 week and the target gains the liftable restriction of being unable to move more than 60 feet away from the caster.

## Counterspell

- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

If you wish, before initiating the casting of this spell, you may make an Intelligence (_arcana_) check contested by the target's Dexterity (_sleight of hand_).  If you succeed and the spell is on your class's list and is of a level you can cast, you learn the spell's identity and what level it is cast at.  If it is not, but you succeed on the check, you learn the spell's type (arcane, divine, or natural), level, and school.

Regardless of the success or failure of the check, you may then cast this spell to attempt to disrupt the magic before it can affect the world.  If the spell is of the level [Counterspell](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/03.md#counterspell) was cast at or lower, the target's fledgling spell immediately fails.  Otherwise, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability where the DC is 13 plus the difference in level between the two spells.  If you succeed on the check, the target's spell immediately fails.  Otherwise, the spell proceeds as normal.

## Deforest

- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous

Choose any creature, object, or magical effect within range. A spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends (if multiple are present and you have used Identify or Detect Magic's focus action, you may select which you target). For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.  When non-spell magical effects are targeted directly, the DC is equal to half the CR of the creature that created it at the time of creation.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.  If not, the DC is reduced by 1 for each spell slot level up this is cast at.

You target a flying creature within range and summon a tremendous blast of air to knock it from the sky.  The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failure, it plummets 100 feet.

Creatures within the cube must make a Dexterity saving throw or receive 3d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  Additionally, all creatures with Tremorsense within the target cube or the 20-foot cube directly below it must make a Constitution save or have that sense blinded.  A tremor-blind creature may repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- **Components**: V, S, M (an hourglass)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

You encase a creature in ice, restraining it and preventing it from casting spells with somatic components or making weapon attacks.  An unwilling creature may attempt to make a Strength saving throw and then again on each of its turns as an action to attempt to break out, ending the spell on a success.  On a failed saving throw, it receives 2d10 cold damage.  While a creature continues to be restrained, it has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Upon taking fire damage, the spell ends early, and the creature is freed.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d10 for each spell level above 3rd.

A creature that fails is outlined in the flames until the end of its next turn or it finds itself outside the area.  During this time, it gains no benefits from being invisible, and attacks against it have advantage.

**Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of this spell increases by 1d8 for each spell level above 3rd.

## Hunger of Hadar

- **School**: Conjuration

- **Components**: V, S, M (a pickled octopus tentacle)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Warlock

You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors. A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration. This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded.

The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 cold damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage as milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against it.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher this is cast at, the acid damage increases by 1d6.

- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

You deeply chill a target creature and compel a Constitution saving throw.  On a failure, a creature receives 4d10 Cold damage, or half as much on a success.  For every 20 points of damage a creature takes from this spell, they suffer one level of exhaustion that lasts for the spell's duration. If the creature receives fire damage, the spell ends.  Creatures with the _Heated Body_ feature or are under the influence of the _Fire Shield_ spell or similar magic are immune to it.

A stroke of lightning forming a line up to 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. If the lightning strikes a creature or barrier (such as a wall), you can choose for it to arc to the nearest creature within the spell's remaining range that it has not yet arced to that is not behind total cover from the arc origin. If there is a tie, you may chooose the creature the bolt arcs to. Each creature in the bolt must then make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## Major Figment

- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create a figment that is no larger than a 20-foot cube.  The figment appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, taste, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a taste or smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the figment, you can use your action to cause it to move to any other spot within range. As the figment changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the figment. For example, if you create a figment of a creature and move it, you can alter the figment so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your Concentration.

## Radiant Barrage

Numerous motes of energy spring into existence around you before catapulting forward.  Select up to 4 creatures in a 90-foot cone, and make a ranged spell attack against each.  On a hit, a creature receives 9d6 radiant damage.

- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Druid

Select an incorporeal creature within range, such as a ghost or a creature affected by the _Incorporealness_ spell.  The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or receive 2d8 psychic damage and become manifest, losing its Incorporeal trait, any resistance or immunity to nonmagical weapons, and its fly speed.

Alternatively, you can cast this spell using the physical remains of an incorporeal undead creature, targeting the undead, even if it is outside the spell's range.  If the target fails its saving throw and is within 1 mile, it is also summoned to a random unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  If the distant target succeeds, however, it is immune to this spell for 24 hours.

## Melf's Minute Meteors

- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create six tiny meteors in your space.  They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration.  When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter, you can expend up to two meteors, sending them streaking toward one or more points within 120 feet of you.  Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts a solid surface, it explodes.  Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw.  A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save or half as much on a success.  Uncontrolled objects automatically take full damage.  Each meteor is its own instance of damage.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell level above 3rd that this spell is cast at, one more meteor is generated.  Additionally, for every two spell levels above 3, as part of the spell's bonus action behavior, you can send an additional meteor.

## Phantom Steed

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Minute Ritual
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Wizard

You create a shadow figment of a _Riding Horse_ on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The shadow figment uses the statistics for a _Riding Horse_, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.

## Pulse

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

You gain tremorsense to a distance of 30 feet for the duration of this spell. Additionally, when you first cast it, as the somatic component, you touch a creature or object, and loose a pulse of energy that causes it to vibrate, as well as any other objects or creatures it touches, any objects or creatures they touch, and so on, out to the range of the tremorsense granted by this spell.  The pulse is strong enough to detect the presence of solids and liquids, but not gases, and can determine fine details, such as the interior mechanisms of a lock.  

Creatures with tremorsense other than you within the range of the spell will gain the same information you do from this pulse, and even creatures without tremorsense within the radius will feel an unnatural vibration.

**Higher Levels**: The radius of the tremorsense increases at higher spell slot levels. At 4th, the range becomes 50 feet. At 5th, 80. 6th, 150. 7th, 500. 8th, 1000. At 9th level, the radius increases to one mile.

## Sending

- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Unlimited
- **Components**: V, S, M (a short copper wire)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are moderately familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner on its next turn as part of this spell. The magic of the spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence.  If the target is on a different plane than you, the DM secretly rolls a d20.  On a 1, the message is not delivered.  If it is delivered and the creature replies, the DM then rolls another d20 to see if you receive the reply.

Messaging a god is likely to inspire divine wrath, earn no response at all, or result in a reply of incomprehensible concepts beyond the caster's understanding.

If you send the message to yourself or someone who is dead, the spell fails.  If the creature is asleep, the message is delivered when the creature awakens.

The following are examples of familiarity that would enable the casting of this spell:

- Someone you have seen the likeness of and know the full name of. Titles and nicknames do not count.
- Someone you have spoken with in person.
- Someone who has previously cast this spell on you.
- Someone with whom you have had written correspondence.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell level higher than 3rd this is cast at, the maximum word count increases by 5 words.

You unleash a beam of negative energy in a 90-foot line that grows stronger with each creature in its path.

Each creature in its path must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or receive 5d8 necrotic damage plus the accumulated damage, or half as much on a success.  The accumulated damage a given creature takes is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier multipled by the number of other creatures the beam passed through before affecting that creature.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 3rd this is cast at, the damage increases by 1d8.

## Spectacular Mane

You touch a creature, and its hair or fur becomes invested with one of the following elements.  The creature's hair changes in appearance to display the element.  Short hair such as arm hair may have a lesser effect such as glowing with an inner fire while longer hair such as a beard may become a roaring flame or flowing locks of lightning.

- **Fire (ruby)**: The creature gains resistance to fire damage.  As a bonus action, it can cause this fire to surge, deal 1d6 fire damage to all other creatures within 5 feet of it and igniting them, dealing this damage again at the end of the damaged creature's turn.  A creature can extinguish itself as an action.
- **Ice (diamond)**: The creature gains resistance to cold damage, and ice creeps outward from the creature's feet.  Any other creature that ends its turn standing within 5 feet and on the same surface as the target receives 1d6 cold damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have its feet frozen to the ground, reducing its speed to zero.  A creature may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.
- **Lightning (sapphire)**: The creature gains resistance to lightning damage.  As a bonus action, the invested creature may hurl a bolt of lightning at a creature within 15 feet of it.  The targeted creature receives 1d6 lightning damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn.
- **Acid (amethyst)**: The creature gains resistance to acid damage.  When the creature is damaged by a melee attack, its attacker receives 1d6 acid damage.
- **Earth (onyx)**: The creature gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.  As a bonus action, the creature may cause a stone spike to momentarily shoot up from a space on the ground within 5 feet of it.  The square around the spike becomes difficult terrain until the beginning of the creature's next turn, and any creatures in that space receive 1d6 piercing damage.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 3rd this is cast at, damage dealt by this spell increases by 1d6.

## Springstone

You call forth a fey spirit that takes the form of a plant.  The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.  This corporeal form uses the [Herbal Spirit](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#herbal-spirit) stat block.  When you cast the spell, choose a form: _Spore_, _Vine_, or _Fungus_, which determines details of stat block.  The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell’s duration.  In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.  It obeys verbal commands you issue (no action required).  If you don’t issue any, it defends itself, but otherwise takes no action.  The spirit is said to have a number of hit dice equal to twice the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, although it cannot use them to heal.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature’s statistics change to reflect this.
