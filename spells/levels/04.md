# Level 4

## Augmenting Wall

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard

You create a trasnlucent wall of energy up to 10 feet high, 20 feet long, and 1 inch thick.  Select an element from the following: fire, cold, poison, acid, lightning.  The wall's color matches the element you select (red for fire, white for cold, green for poison, smokey for acid, and blue for lightning).  Physical projectiles (that were not conjured by spells) and thrown weapons that pass through the wall have their damage increased by 1d10 of the selected type.  The wall does not block vision or have any effect on a creature that passes through it.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 4th this is cast at, you may increase the length of the wall by ten feet or the height by 5.  When cast at 6th level or greater, the wall becomes monodirectional, facing as you please.

## Azdregath's Creeping Concoction

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create three puddles of toxic goo on the ground on points you can see within range, with each taking the form of a 10-foot square that counts as difficult terrain.  Creatures that enter the space of a puddle for the first time on their turn or begin their turn within one must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 2d8 Poison damage, receiving half on success.

On each of your turns while the spell lasts, you can use a bonus action to move some or all of the puddles of your choice up to 5 feet along the ground.  The puddles can move up gradual inclines or stairs, but cannot climb walls of five feet or more.  If two puddles fully overlap with one another, they merge, resulting in a puddle that does 1d8 more damage than the stronger of the component puddles.  If multiple puddles are spawned atop each other at the start of the spell, they merge immediately.

Puddles created by multiple castings of this spell do not merge if they coexist in a space.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 4th this is cast with, you can spawn an additional puddle, and the speed of all puddles increases by 5 feet, but they do not become more proficient in overcoming walls.

## Breed True

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Hour
- **Range**: 10 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (fresh mistletoe)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

You select a number of traits in the target creature such as strength, eye color, or size, up to your spellcasting ability modifier.  When the creature next sires offspring or becomes pregnant, those traits are guaranteed to appear in its children.

## Dissolve

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 20 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You channel a stream of caustic acid at a target and deal 6d6 acid damage to it.  If the target is a creature, it can make a Dexterity saving throw for half damage.

Each round while the spell persists, you may select the same or a different target to direct the stream at as an action.

**Higher Levels**: For each level higher, the damage increases by 2d6.

## Glamored Terrain

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 10 Minutes
- **Range**: 300 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a leaf)
- **Duration**: 24 hours
- **Classes**: Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard

You apply a glamor to make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain.  Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.  A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.  Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.

## Gravel Vortex

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 400 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pebble)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You point to a target location an immense whirling vortex of pebbles in the form of a cylinder 20 feet tall and 80 feet wide.  Creatures inside the volume must make a Strength save or receive 6d8 bludgeoning damage.  A creature receives half as much damage on a success.  The pebbles persist after the spell, coating the area to six inches deep, turning the area into difficult terrain.

## Gravity Well

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You target a point on the ground you can see within range, and stretch the world toward it, creating a black pinpoint in space with swirling light around it in a 30-foot radius.  Creatures that start their turns within the radius of the target point or enter the radius for the first time on their turns must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled inward, landing prone on the nearest unoccupied space around the gravity well, and be restrained.  While within the radius, a creatures that are not restrained must use their climbing speed instead of walking speed.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 4th this is cast at, the range and radius both increase by 10 feet.

## Isabelle's Steelmantle

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Classes**: Cleric, Paladin

By speaking aloud, you curse a creature you can see within range, and thwart healing on it.  For the duration, its skin and clothing appear metallic.  The next time the target would receive healing, it instead receives an equivalent amount of radiant damage.  This spell then ends.

The damage dealt by this spell cannot exceed 10 times the level of the spell level this was cast at.

## Kieron's Barricade

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Reaction, which you take when are threatened by a ranged attack, non-attack projectile magical effect (such as Fireball), a line effect, or a cone effect
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

A 10x10 foot stone barricade instantly appears 10 feet away from you directly between you and the triggering threat, potentially appearing in the air.  The barrier is 3 inches thick and has 10 hit points per inch.  The barricade is automatically struck by the incoming threat.  If the threat is a non-attack projectile that targets a point in space, the target point becomes the impact point.  If the threat has an area of effect, its effect against creatures and objects behind the barrier is reduced by the hit points of the barrier unless the threat has an effect that goes around corners.

Whether or not the barricade survives the threat, it vanishes immediately afterwards.

**Higher Levels**: When this spell is cast with a spell slot of 5th level or above, another barrier is summoned for each spell slot level above 4th.  These additional barriers are only 1 inch thick and sequentially appear 10 feet beyond the previous barrier along the path between you and the source of the threat.

## Overgrow

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid

You scatter up to three nonmagical seeds toward a string of contiguous surface locations within 60 feet of you.  Each of those seeds then takes root, even if the surface would not normally allow a plant to grow there.  Each plant bursts forth and occupies a 5-foot cube.  An existing nonmagical plant that is not a creature that is already occupying a target location can be substituted for a seed.  Any creatures in those spaces are harmlessly pushed to the side in the direction of their choice.  The plants have an AC of 12, vulnerability to fire damage, and have 30 hit points.  If the plants sprouted or modified by this spell have special resistances or vulnerabilities apply those as well.

At the start of each of your following turns while this spell persists, the plants regain all hit points as they grow another 5 feet of height in a direction of your choice if there is space for them, potentially allowing unnatural shapes such as bridges or buildings made from trees.  Each plant may grow in a separate direction.

While the spell persists, the plants radiate transmutation magic, but once it ends, the magic ends and the plants become mundane.  If the plants are of an egregiously different scale than their species would normally allow or in a hostile environment, at the DM’s discretion, they may not survive long-term without magical assistance.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell slot level above 4th that you cast this spell at, you may scatter two additional seeds.

## Skip

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: S, M (a clock that ticks as fast as normal)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

You and anything you are wearing or carrying lurch forward in time to the beginning of your next turn.  If you are grappling another creature, unless you are a size larger than it or more, it does not count as being carried.  To any witnesses, you vanish with a quiet sucking sound as soon as you finish casting this spell and reappear suddenly with a pop at the initiative count for your next turn.

Any already-active concentration spells you previously cast remain in effect and move forward through time normally without you.

If a creature or object occupies your space when you re-enter time, both you and the obstruction receive 8d10 Force damage and you are shunted to the nearest open location.

## Stone Shape

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Wizard

You touch a stone object or Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose.  So, for example, you could shape a rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall less than 5 feet thick.  You could also shape a door or its frame to seal the door shut.  The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible with a single casting of this spell.

To create fine detail with this spell, you must make a series of Charisma (Performance) checks with a cumulative Detail Grade determined by the DM that the caster works toward with several castings of this spell.  An incredibly lifelike statue of a person might have a detail grade of 200, but even a single casting could form an obvious humanoid shape.  Use the following formula:

`New Detail Grade = Performance - (Old Detail Grade / 20) + Old Detail Grade`

## Storm Spear

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 300 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You summon a crackling bolt of energy and hurl it toward a creature or uncontrolled object within range.  Make a ranged spell attack.  On a hit, the creature takes 3d12 lightning damage and 3d12 piercing damage.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell level above 4th this is cast at, this spell deals an additional 1d12 lightning damage.

## Synara's Frozen Grasp

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Stalagmites of ice surge up from a point on the ground you can see within range.  Creatures within 15 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failure, a creature receives 2d6 cold damage and 2d6 piercing damage and is restrained, having been impaled by the ice.  On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not restrained.  A restrained creature can repeat the save as an action, ending the effect on itself on a success, or receiving an additional 2d6 points of piercing damage on a failure.

A creature with Heated Body or a similar effect cannot be restrained by this spell, and a creature restrained by this spell ceases to be restrained if it receives fire damage.

**Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 4th.

## Watery Sphere

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, M (a dried octopus tentacle)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You conjure up a sphere of water with a 10-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range.  The sphere can hover in the air, but can be no more than 10 feet off the ground.  The sphere remains for the duration.

Any creature in the sphere’s space must make a Strength saving throw.  On a successful save, the creature is ejected  from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside the sphere.  On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the sphere and engulfed by the water, smothering its speech.  At the end of each of its turns, the creature may repeat this saving throw.

The sphere can restrain a creature if space unoccupied spaces remain inside it that can fully encompass the creature.

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line.  If it moves or appears over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet over the ground once more.  Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it.  You can ram the sphere into creatures with this movement.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of it.  Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone where it falls.

**Higher Levels**: For every slot level above 4th this is cast at, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet and the radius of extinguishing flame increases by 10 feet.

## Widogast's Web of Fire

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

Striking both palms on the ground, a web of flame crackles around you and streaks outward as five zigzagging lines of fire.  Each line targets a creature on the ground that you can see within range.  The lines can climb over obstacles as high as 5 feet, and navigate around creatures and objects of your choice, but cannot pass over water, and they ignite any flammable objects that are not being worn or carried that they pass over.  When a line reaches a creature, it erupts in a pillar of flame.

The first line a creature is subjected to from a single casting of this spell deals 7d6 fire damage, with each additional line targeting the same creature dealing an additional 1d6 fire damage.  A creature may attempt a Dexterity saving throw to resist the effects, receiving only half damage on success.  Creatures do not benefit from partial cover when targeted by this spell.

**Higher Levels**: For every slot level above 4th this is cast at, this spell creates an additional line of fire.
