The wall's color matches the element you select (red for fire, white for cold, green for poison, smokey for acid, and blue for lightning).

The wall does not block vision or have any effect on a creature that passes through it.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level above 4th this is cast at, you may increase the length of the wall by 10 feet or the height by 5 feet.  When cast at 6th level or greater, the wall's magical enhancement only applies to projectiles exiting a side of the wall of your choice.

## Azdregath's Creeping Concoction

- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 120 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You create three puddles of toxic goo on the ground on points you can see within range, with each taking the form of a 10-foot square that counts as difficult terrain.  Creatures that enter the space of a puddle for the first time on their turn or begin their turn within one must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 2d8 poison damage, receiving half on success.

On each of your turns while the spell lasts, you can use a bonus action to move some or all of the puddles of your choice up to 5 feet along the ground.  The puddles can move up gradual inclines or stairs, but cannot climb walls of five feet or more.  If two puddles fully overlap with one another, they merge, resulting in a puddle that does 1d8 more damage than the stronger of the component puddles.  If multiple puddles are spawned atop each other at the start of the spell, they merge immediately.

Puddles created by multiple castings of this spell do not merge if they coexist in a space.

**Higher Levels**: For each spell level higher than 4th this is cast with, you can spawn an additional puddle, and the speed of all puddles increases by 5 feet, but they do not become more proficient in overcoming walls.

The target takes 9d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain.  A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.  Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area arenâ€™t changed in appearance.

A storm of freezing rain cascades downward in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.  The spell sucks heat from the creatures within the radius and covers exposed surfaces in a thin layer of ice.  Each creature within the radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 6d8 cold damage, or half as much on a success.  Until the start of your next turn, icy surfaces created by the spell become difficult terrain, and creatures that begin their turn standing on the icy surfaces or that walk onto them for the first time on their turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

## Kieron's Barricade

- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

A 10x10 foot stone barricade instantly appears 10 feet away from you, directly between you and the triggering threat, potentially appearing in the air.  The barrier is 3 inches thick and has 10 hit points per inch.  The barricade is automatically struck by the incoming threat.  If the threat is a non-attack projectile that targets a point in space, the target point becomes the impact point.  If the threat has an area of effect, its effect against creatures and objects behind the barrier is reduced by the hit points of the barrier unless the threat has an effect that goes around corners.

Whether or not the barricade survives the threat, it vanishes immediately afterwards.

**Higher Levels**: When this spell is cast with a spell slot of 5th level or above, another barrier is summoned for each spell slot level above 4th.  These additional barriers are only 1 inch thick and sequentially appear 10 feet beyond the previous barrier along the path between you and the source of the threat.

As a bonus action while at least one object remains in orbit, you can magically fling it at target within 60 feet. Make a ranged spell attack roll. On hit, the target takes 3d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked backward 5 feet.

## Overgrow

- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, M (up to three seeds, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid

You scatter up to three nonmagical seeds, buds, or saplings toward points you can see within 60 feet of you that; each space must be within 5 feet of another.  Each of those seeds then takes root, even if the surface would not normally allow a plant to grow there.  Each plant bursts forth as an [Overgrowth](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#overgrowth) and occupies a 5-foot cube.

At the start of each of your following turns while this spell persists, the plants regain all hit points as they grow another 5 feet of height in a direction of your choice if there is space for them, potentially allowing unnatural shapes such as bridges or buildings made from trees.  Each plant may grow in a separate direction.

While the spell persists, the plants radiate transmutation magic, but once it ends, the magic ends and the plants become mundane.  If the plants are of an egregiously different scale than their species would normally allow or in a hostile environment, at the DMâ€™s discretion, they may not survive long-term without magical assistance.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell slot level above 4th that you cast this spell at, you may scatter two additional seeds.

If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell's target even if you can't see it. If the named target isn't within range, the lance dissipates without effect.

The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't incapacitated.

**Higher Levels**: For every spell slot level above 4th that you cast this spell at, the damage increases by 1d6.

- **Components**: S, M (a clock that ticks twice as fast as normal)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard

You and your controlled objects lurch forward in time to the beginning of your next turn.  To any witnesses, you vanish with a quiet sucking sound as soon as you finish casting this spell and reappear suddenly with a pop at the initiative count for your next turn.

Any already-active concentration spells you previously cast remain in effect and move forward through time normally without you.

If a creature or object occupies your space when you re-enter time, both you and the obstruction receive 8d10 force damage, and you are shunted to the nearest open location.

## Stone Shape

- **Components**: V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Wizard

You touch a stone object or section of one that is no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose.  For example, you could shape a rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall less than 5 feet thick.  You could also shape a door or its frame to seal the door shut.  The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible with a single casting of this spell.

To create fine detail with this spell, you must make a series of Charisma (performance) checks with a cumulative Detail Grade determined by the DM that the caster works toward with several castings of this spell.  An incredibly lifelike statue of a person might have a detail grade of 200, but even a single casting could form an obvious humanoid shape.  Use the following formula:

`New Detail Grade = Performance - (Old Detail Grade / 20) + Old Detail Grade`

Stalagmites of ice surge up from a point on the ground you can see within range.  Creatures within 15 feet of the point must make a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failure, a creature receives 2d6 cold damage and 2d6 piercing damage and is restrained, having been impaled by the ice.  On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not restrained.  A restrained creature can repeat the save as an action, ending the effect on itself on a success, or receiving an additional 2d6 points of piercing damage on a failure.

A creature with Heated Body or a similar effect cannot be restrained by this spell, and a creature restrained by this spell ceases to be restrained if it receives fire damage.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, automatically deals the full rolled damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the the wall on that side.

- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You conjure up a sphere of water with a 10-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range.  The sphere can hover in the air, but can be no more than 10 feet off the ground.  The sphere remains for the duration.

Any creature in the sphereâ€™s space must make a Strength saving throw.  On a successful save, the creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside the sphere.  On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the sphere and engulfed by the water, smothering its speech.  At the end of each of its turns, the creature may repeat this saving throw.

The sphere can restrain a creature if space unoccupied spaces remain inside it that can fully encompass the creature.

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line.  If it moves or appears over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet over the ground once more.  Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it.  You can ram the sphere into creatures with this movement.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of it.  Any creature restrained by the sphere is released and lands prone on the ground safely.

**Higher Levels**: For every slot level above 4th this is cast at, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet and the radius of extinguishing flame increases by 10 feet.

Striking both palms on the ground, a web of flame crackles around you and streaks outward as four zigzagging lines of fire.  Each line targets a creature on the ground that you can see within range.  The lines can climb over obstacles as high as 5 feet, and navigate around creatures and objects of your choice, but cannot pass over water, and they ignite any flammable objects that are not being worn or carried that they pass over.  When a line reaches a creature, it erupts in a pillar of flame.

The first line a creature is subjected to from a single casting of this spell deals 7d6 fire damage, with each additional line targeting the same creature increasing the damage by 1d6.
