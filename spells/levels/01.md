You conjure an [Opulent Ooze](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/monsters/Monster%20Blocks.md#opulent-ooze) loyal to you that appears in an unoccupied 5-foot cube you can see within range.  The ooze's surface can be any opaque metallic color of your choice.

You can climb atop it as an action or dismount as an action.  While mounted, you sink three inches into the ooze and gain simple telepathic control over it, directing its movement as if it were your own, and attempts to unseat you have disadvantage.  While mounted on the ooze, you cannot dash.

Finally, while unmounted, you may place your hand on the ooze and telepathically order it as a bonus action to either stay where it is or to retrieve an uncontrolled object you describe that is no more than 100 feet away.

If the projectile would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the projectile strikes the target and stops moving. When the projectile strikes something, the projectile and what it strikes each take 3d8 bludgeoning damage. At the DM's discretion, this damage type may be changed based on the projectile's nature. For example, a launched dagger might deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

If the projectile has any special effects that trigger on a hit with an attack, such as a net restraining a creature, an acid vial damaging the target, or a magic weapon dealing bonus damage, those effects are applied to whatever the projectile strikes.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.

Constructs, undead, plants, and creatures that lack blood are immune to this damage.  The leeches last for the duration of the spell and are immune to damage, but a creature can use its action or a 1-cost legendary action to remove all leeches from itself or an ally within five feet of it.  Once removed, leeches fall to the ground, wither, and die.

- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You place a visual glamor on an object within range (such as a rug or an illusion of a rug).  The glamor takes the form of adding apparent depth to an object, such as making a room appear off to the side of a hallway or making a pit seem to appear in the floor.  The glamor and the illusory room within may be any shape you desire, but cannot be larger than 10 feet by 10 feet and the illusory room cannot be more than 20 feet deep.  The parallax room created by this spell may be any solid color of your choice and light interacts with the glamor so as to make the room seem real.  For example, if this spell is used to create a pit, a creature standing at the edge would be able to see all the way down, whereas a creature farther back would not be able to see what is at the bottom of the illusory pit.

For the duration, the interior of the room becomes a valid target location for other illusion spells.  If you apply another casting of this spell to an existing parallax room, you may extend the room by the same rules as before.  When this spell ends for any reason, anything inside it or any parallax rooms that branched off it are safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space outside the terminated glamor.

If this spell is subjected to Illusory Reality, this room and any that branch from it become real and are extradimensional.  If this expires while a creature or real object is inside it, the creature or object is safely shunted outside, as if the spell had ended.

**Higher Levels**: When cast with a 6th level spell slot or higher, the room lasts until dispelled.  If when you cast it in this way, you subject it to Illusory Reality, it is real until dispelled.
