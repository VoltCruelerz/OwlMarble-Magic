## Azdregath's Opulent Ooze

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action Ritual
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Artificer, Wizard

You conjure an [Opulent Ooze](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/Monster%20Blocks.md#opulent-ooze) loyal to you that appears in an unoccupied 5-foot cube you can see within range.  The ooze's surface can be any opaque metallic color of your choice.

You can climb atop it as an action or dismount as an action.  While mounted, you sink three inches into the ooze and gain simple telepathic control over it, directing its movement as if it were your own, and attempts to unseat you have disadvantage.  While mounted on the ooze, you cannot dash.

Finally, while unmounted, you may place your hand on the ooze and telepathically order it as a bonus action to either stay where it is or to retrieve an uncontrolled object you describe that is no more than 100 feet away.

## Disguise Self

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You place a glamor on yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – to look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it.

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the glamor is up to you.

## Dye

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action Ritual
- **Range**: 15 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

Using a finite color palette, you recolor an uncontrolled object with whatever pattern you choose, but the entire surface of the object must be covered by one of the colors in the palette.  A palette color can be partially transparent, in which case it does not fully cover any existing coloration in the target.

The size of the palette is four to the power of one less than the level of the spell slot used to cast this.

The spell actually alters the pigmentation of the object, so it cannot be dispelled.

## Ease Labor

- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Special
- **Classes**: Cleric

You touch a creature in labor or giving birth and ease the pain she is feeling for as long as you remain within 15 feet of her.  If she needs to make any Constitution saving throws due to complications from the birth, she has advantage on them.

You touch a creature, and apply a shadow glamor for the duration.  The creature gains the appearance of either a more or less attractive version of itself (your choice), but the creature is still unmistakably itself.  For example, teeth may straighten, hair may become thicker and more lustrous, minor blemishes may be hidden, body form subtly improves, and clothing becomes more vibrant and new.  The exact details are up to the caster.

Critical identifying features (such as a tattoo, scar, or eye color) may not be altered by this spell, but aesthetic changes to them are possible.  For example, a scar could be made to look less gnarled or a tattoo could be made to look less faded.

If cast on an unwilling creature, the target may make a Charisma saving throw to resist.

- At 2th level, it extends to 24 hours
- At 3rd level, it extends to 1 week

All creatures and objects in a 20-foot cube within range must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice), shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius.  Creatures and objects gain no benefits from being invisible while outlined by this spell.  Additionally, any attack roll against a creature or object outlined has advantage.  Creatures continue to be outlined as long as the spell persists, even if they leave the area.

- **Casting Time**: 1 Action Ritual
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Wizard

You touch a document transcribed on paper, parchment, or spellpaper. The document then winds itself up, and a magical wax seal that glitters with internal light appears on it. Upon a creature breaking the seal, a timer begins to count down, which is displayed alongside the text of the document as an illusion. At zero, the parchment disintegrates itself. You select the length of the timer when you cast this spell.

## Slick

_replaces Grease_

- **School**: Conjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of butter or ice)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Wizard

You cover a 10-foot square within range in a slippery inert substance such as grease or ice.  The target area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.  When the spell is cast, any creatures within the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.  A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect an additional 10-foot square.  All target squares created by this spell must be contiguous.

## Image

_replaces Silent Image_

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You create a visual figment that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The figment appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration.  It may emit light, but may be no brighter than shedding bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond the bright radius.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

## Longstrider

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Touch
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bone from a cheetah)
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard

A willing creature you touch has its walking speed increased by 15, and it is immune to exhaustion from dashing for 1 hour.

## Parallax Room

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You place a visual glamor on an object within range (such as a rug or an illusion of a rug).  The glamor takes the form of adding apparent depth to an object, such as making a room appear off to the side of a hallway or making a pit seem to appear in the floor.  The glamor and the illusory room within may be any shape you desire, but cannot be larger than 10 feet by 10 feet and the illusory room cannot be more than 20 feet deep.  The parallax room created by this spell may be any solid color of your choice and light interacts with the glamor so as to make the room seem real.  For example, if this spell is used to create a pit, a creature standing at the edge would be able to see all the way down, whereas a creature farther back would not be able to see what is at the bottom of the illusory pit.

For the duration, the interior of the room becomes a valid target location for other illusion spells.  If you apply another casting of this spell to an existing parallax room, you may extend the room by the same rules as before.  When this spell ends for any reason, anything inside it or any parallax rooms that branched off it are safely shunted to the nearest unoccupied space outside the terminated glamor.

If this spell is subjected to Illusory Reality, this room and any that branch from it become real and are extradimensional.  If this expires while a creature or real object is inside it, the creature or object is safely shunted outside, as if the spell had ended.

**Higher Levels**: When cast with a 6th level spell slot or higher, the room lasts until dispelled.  If when you cast it in this way, you subject it to Illusory Reality, it is real until dispelled.

## Reassemble

- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a bottle of glue)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Artificer, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard

You reassemble the fragments of a destroyed inanimate object that would fit within a 5-foot cube so long as the fragments are not being restrained from returning to the target location and are within 100 feet.  An object repaired by this spell will have 1 hit point and will not be structurally sound.  If the target was an undead or construct, the body will be restored, but it will not be reactivated.

**Higher Levels**: For each slot higher than 1st, the side length of the cube increases by 5 feet.

## Sleep

- **School**: Enchantment
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber.  Roll 8d4, the total of which is the number of hit points of creatures this spell can effect.  Creatures within a 20-foot radius sphere of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points.

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or another creature uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.  Subtract each creature's current hit points from the total before moving onto the next-lowest hit point creature.  If a creature has more remaining hit points than the remaining total, the creature is not affected.

Undead and creatures immune to charms aren't affected by this spell.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 5d4 for each slot above 1st.  When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you instead roll an additional 10d4 for each slot above 5th.

## Warp Strike

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 15 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard, Ranger, Warlock, Wizard

With a burst of speed, you travel via the most direct to a target point you can see within range that is adjacent to a creature, and then immediately make a melee attack with a weapon against that creature.  This attack is made with advantage.  During the movement caused by this spell, opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.

**Higher Levels**: For every two spell levels above 1st this is cast at, the range increases by 20 feet, and you may make another attack with advantage against the creature.

## Witch Bolt

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 30 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a twig from a tree that was struck by lightning)
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature or uncontrolled object within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.

Make a ranged spell attack against that target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC).  On each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically and reassert the grapple if the creature has escaped. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot above 1st.  Additionally, at 3rd level, you may grapple targets that are size Large or smaller without them having advantage to break out due to size difference.  At 5th level, this extends to Huge creatures, which cannot break the grapple automatically due to size difference.  Finally, at 7th level, this extends to Gargantuan creatures.
