## Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 150 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a sponge)
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range.  Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw.  Constructs and Undead aren't affected, but plants and water elementals make the saving throw with disadvantage.  A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage failed save, or half as much on a success.  Non-magical plants in the area that aren't creatures wither and die instantly.

Additionally, a creature that fails its save finds it difficult to function and think due to dehydration.  Such a creature is subjected to the effects of the Poisoned status.  At the end of each of its turns, the creature may repeat the saving throw, ending this effect on a success.

## Accelerate

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 60 feet
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

You accelerate the flow of time around a creature or object you can see within range.  If a creature is unwilling, it can make a Wisdom saving throw to resist.

For the duration, the target experiences time at twice its normal rate, granting it a +5 bonus to its armor class and dexterity saving throws.  Additionally, at the end of the target’s first turn each round, it immediately takes another turn, but on its second turn, it cannot cast a leveled spell if it did so on its first turn.  Also, if the creature takes the _Use an Object_ action on its first turn, it cannot take the same action with the same object on its second turn.

## Aura of Invisibility

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard

Up to 6 willing creatures that you can see within range turn invisible.  Until the spell ends, each creature and whatever they are wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is within range of you.  At any point, a creature can choose to be visible until the start of its next turn.  You and each target can see through this invisibility.

## Banshee's Wail

- **School**: Evocation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (90-foot radius)
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You release a terrible screech from your lips.  Creatures that can hear you within range must and aren't undead succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or receive 12d6 thunder damage, half on success.  A creature that fails its saving throw by 5 or more dies.

## Boulder Roll

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 150 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid

You reach deep into the earth and summon three boulders that tear themselves from the terrain in locations of your choice within range. Each boulder has a radius of 10 feet and leaves a hole with the same radius.  When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can command the boulders to roll directly toward points of your choice within 150 feet of you.  The boulders can climb sheer cliffs and can jump over gaps up to 50 feet wide, but they cannot end their movement on unsupported spaces.

A creature or object in the path of a rolling boulder must make a Strength saving throw or be crushed by its passage, receiving 5d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone.  A creature that succeeds receives half damage as it is shunted to the side.

If a boulder ends its movement atop a creature, the creature is restrained.  As an action, the creature may make an Strength (athletics) check against your spell save DC to attempt to free itself.  If it succeeds, it is safely shunted to the side but remains prone.

A creature atop a boulder may attempt to ride it as it moves by making a DC 15 Dexterity (acrobatics) check.  You automatically succeed on this check.  A creature that fails the check falls into the path of the boulder as it moves.  Creatures standing where the boulders emerge begin atop them.

**Higher Levels**: When this spell is cast with a 9th level slot, a 4th boulder is summoned.

## Chronicle

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: Self (1-mile radius)
- **Components**: V, S, M (a flip-book animation of a king doing something and a diamond worth at least 8000gp)

- **Classes**: Bard

You magically transcribe all that occurs around you in the material component gemstone such that anyone who shines a magical light through the gemstone will be presented with a life-size illusion that replays all that happened around you over the spell's duration.  If you cast this spell again with the same diamond, it will overwrite the previous casting of the spell.

## Eruption

- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 500 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M (a shard of obsidian and ground pumice)
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Classes**: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

The earth bucks upward at a target point on the ground that you can see within range as magma builds below and bursts upward in a pillar of molten rock.  Creatures within a cylinder 100 feet high with a 15-foot radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 10d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success.  After the initial eruption, the lava spreads out into a shallow pool with a 30 foot radius.  If on a steep incline, the pool of lava flows downhill at 5 feet per round at the beginning of each of your turns.

Movement through the lava pool is extremely difficult.  Every five feet of movement through the lava consumes 10 additional feet of movement and deals 1d6 points of fire damage.

A creature that begins its turn within the pool or moves into the pool for the first time on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 4d6 fire damage, half on success.

After one minute, the lava hardens to rock.  Creatures within the lava at the time become restrained.  A creature can use an action to try to free a restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check to pull the creature free or by dealing damage to it. The rock around a creature’s feet has an AC of 15 and 25 hit points.

**Higher Levels**: If this spell is cast with a 9th level slot, every five feet of movement through the lava pool deals an additional 1d6 damage.

## Eternal Rest

- **School**: Necromancy
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 90 feet
- **Components**: V, S
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Cleric

You fire a searing beam of golden light at one creature within range.  If the creature is an undead of CR 8 or lower, it is annihilated in a flash of light, leaving no trace.  Otherwise, make a ranged spell attack, dealing 10d12 Radiant damage on a hit.

**Higher Levels**: If you cast this spell with a 9th level slot, the spell deals an additional 2d12 damage, and it can automatically destroy undead of CR 9 or below.

## Fissure

- **School**: Transmutation
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 300 feet
- **Components**: V, S, M
- **Duration**: Instantaneous
- **Classes**: Druid, Wizard

Select a point you can see within range.  You cause an area of natural terrain 30 feet wide and 150 feet long to detonate, throwing debris into the air.  The area is centered on the point and may be in any orientation you choose.  Creatures on or above the affected terrain that are 30 feet or less off the ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 12d10 bludgeoning damage, half on success.

The area of the spell becomes difficult terrain until cleared.  Each 5-foot square requires 1 minute to clear by hand.

- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You gain the ability to move creatures and objects by thought.  For the duration, you have a fly (hover) speed of 30 feet.  As an action while the spell persists, you can perform one of the abilities below, targeting a huge or smaller creature or object within range.  On following turns, you can change targets and abilities.

If it is an unwilling creature or controlled object, the creature can make a strength check contested by a spellcasting ability check to resist the effect.  If you win the contest and the target is a creature, you may choose to restrain the target until the end of your next turn.

### Telekinetic Abilities

- **Move**: You move a creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward.
- **Crush**: You painfully squeeze the target, dealing 6d10 bludgeoning damage.  If the target is a creature, you can strangle it, forcing it to hold its breath until the end of your next turn.  If during this time, the creature attempts to speak or cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or fail to get the words out.  If it was attempting to cast a spell, no resources are wasted.
- **Manipulate**: You have excellent fine motor control with this spell.  If you would make a tool check that would require Dexterity or Strength, you may use your spellcasting ability modifier instead, and you make the check with advantage.
- **Launch**: Select up to three objects weighing no more than 10 pounds each that are within range.  Each object then flies up to 150 feet in directions of your choice before falling to the ground.  If a projectile impacts a creature or object early, both the projectile and what it impacted receive 3d10 damage of a type appropriate for the projectile.  A creature in a projectile’s path may make a dexterity saving throw to avoid it.

**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell at 9th level, you can use two abilities as part of the same action.  Alternatively, you can use the same ability twice.  When cast at 10th level, the abilities of this spell only require your bonus action.

## Illusory Dragon

- **School**: Illusion
- **Casting Time**: 1 Action
- **Range**: 150 feet
- **Components**: S
- **Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes**: Wizard

You create a Huge shadow figment of a dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell’s duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.

When the figment appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the figment up to 80 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The figment is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically. it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions.

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range.  The cloud spreads around corners and heavily obscures its contents.  Its area is considered difficult terrain, and uncontrolled flammable items instantly ignite within it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw.  A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there.

At the beginning of each of your turns, you can move the cloud up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.

## Salvation

- **School**: Abjuration
- **Casting Time**: 1 Reaction, which you take when you see a creature take damage
- **Range**: Unlimited
- **Components**: V
- **Duration**: 1 round
- **Classes**: Cleric

You cry out to your god to shield the triggering creature from harm, and a beam of golden light streaks down from the sky, passing through solid and magical barriers along the way.  The target regains 50 hit points, all grapples on it end, and if it is prone, it can stand (no action required).  Creatures of your choice within 20 feet of the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be hurled back 30 feet, landing prone.

Until the end of the target's next turn, it cannot be reduced below 1 hit point by any means, even [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish).

The effects of this spell take place immediately after the triggering damage is dealt, but before any secondary effects (such as automatic death upon reducing a creature to 0 hit points) occur.
