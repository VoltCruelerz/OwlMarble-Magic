Non-magical plants in the area that aren't creatures wither and die instantly.

Additionally, a creature that fails its save finds it difficult to function and think due to dehydration.  Such a creature is subjected to the effects of the Poisoned status.  At the end of each of its turns, the creature may repeat the saving throw, ending this effect on a success.

Additionally, at the end of the targetâ€™s first turn each round, it immediately takes another turn, but on its second turn, it cannot cast a leveled spell if it did so on its first turn.

You reach deep into the earth and summon three boulders that tear themselves from the terrain in locations of your choice within range.

When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can command the boulders to roll directly toward points of your choice within 150 feet of you.  The boulders can climb sheer cliffs and can jump over gaps up to 50 feet wide, but they cannot end their movement on unsupported spaces.

A creature or object in the path of a rolling boulder must make a Strength saving throw or be crushed by its passage, receiving 5d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone.  A creature that succeeds receives half damage as it is shunted to the side.

If a boulder ends its movement atop a creature, the creature is restrained.  As an action, the creature may make an Strength (athletics) check against your spell save DC to attempt to free itself.  If it succeeds, it is safely shunted to the side but remains prone.

A creature atop a boulder may attempt to ride it as it moves by making a DC 15 Dexterity (acrobatics) check.  You automatically succeed on this check.  A creature that fails the check falls into the path of the boulder as it moves.  Creatures standing where the boulders emerge begin atop them.

You magically transcribe all that occurs around you in the material component gemstone such that anyone who shines a magical light through the gemstone will be presented with a life-size illusion that replays all that happened around you over the spell's duration.

## Damiana's Statue

- **Duration**: Permanent
- **Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard

Over the casting of this spell, you shape the components into a life-size depiction of yourself in any pose or attire, and you may choose to imbue it with a spell. The spell must be of 3rd level or lower, and you must know it and have it prepared while creating the statue.

The statue has an AC equal to your spell save DC, 300 hit points, and it is immune to nonmagical damage from weapons that are not adamantine.

While you are in contact with the statue, you can set activation criteria of your choice, causing it to animate as a [Sorcerer's Statue](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master//monsters/Monster%20Blocks.md#sorcerer's-statue), inheriting your mental scores, languages, and personality. The criteria can be any complexity, from something as simple as a command word, to something as elaborate as only activating if a goblin in a blue hat on a Tuesday fails to say a password while on a particular tile in the room. Once activated, the statue remains active for one hour, and cannot be reactivated until the next dawn.

Additionally, as a bonus action while within 1 mile of the statue, you can forge a telepathic link to it and activate it that way as well as communicate with it.

If you create a new statue with the same spell slot, the previous statue loses its enchantment and becomes mundane.

This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.

For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 8d10 damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. The type of the damage is determined by your alignment. If you are good aligned, it is radiant. If you are evil, it is your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

If you are good, and a chromatic dragon is caught in the area or if you are evil and you hit a metallic dragon, the damage is maximized for the dragon.

The earth bucks upward at a target point on the ground that you can see within range as magma builds below and bursts upward in a pillar of molten rock.  Creatures within a cylinder 100 feet high with a 15-foot radius must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive 10d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success.  After the initial eruption, the lava spreads out into a shallow pool with a 30 foot radius.  If on a steep incline, the pool of lava flows downhill at 5 feet per round at the beginning of each of your turns.

Movement through the lava pool is extremely difficult.  Every five feet of movement through the lava consumes 10 additional feet of movement and deals 1d6 points of fire damage.

A creature that begins its turn within the pool or moves into the pool for the first time on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw or receive 4d6 fire damage, half on success.

After one minute, the lava hardens to rock.  Creatures within the lava at the time become restrained.  A creature can use an action to try to free a restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check to pull the creature free or by dealing damage to it. The rock around a creatureâ€™s feet has an AC of 15 and 25 hit points.

**Higher Levels**: If this spell is cast with a 9th level slot, every five feet of movement through the lava pool deals an additional 1d6 damage.

Creatures on or above the affected terrain that are 30 feet or less off the ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 12d10 bludgeoning damage, half on success.

The area of the spell becomes difficult terrain until cleared.  Each 5-foot square requires 1 minute to clear by hand.

Each target creature must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself on a success.

If a creature is translocated, the threads maintain their connection to the creature, provided the destination was within range of the original cast.

A creature or object is instantly freed if the threads are targeted with _Disentegrate_ or similar magic.

You gain the ability to locally control the direction of gravity within range. Within range, you can change the flow of gravity to be any uniform direction you like, and can be anywhere between no strength at all and twice its normal strength. If gravity is twice its normal strength, creatures attempting to stand must make a Strength saving throw or fall prone, and creatures take twice as much damage from collisions and falls.

You can choose to exempt yourself from this spell.

**Higher Levels**: If you cast this spell with a 9th level slot, you can push gravity to four times its normal strength, increasing damage from collisions and falls up to four times, and creatures have disadvantage on the Strength saving throw.

On following turns, you can change targets and abilities.

If it is an unwilling creature or controlled object, the creature can make a strength check contested by a spellcasting ability check to resist the effect.  If you win the contest and the target is a creature, you may choose to restrain the target until the end of your next turn.

### Telekinetic Abilities

- **Move**: You move a creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward.
- **Crush**: You painfully squeeze the target, dealing 6d10 bludgeoning damage.  If the target is a creature, you can strangle it, forcing it to hold its breath until the end of your next turn.  If during this time, the creature attempts to speak or cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or fail to get the words out.  If it was attempting to cast a spell, no materials or spell slot resources are wasted.
- **Manipulate**: You have excellent fine motor control with this spell.  If you would make a tool check that would require Dexterity or Strength, you may use your spellcasting ability modifier instead, and you make the check with advantage.
- **Launch**: Select up to three objects weighing no more than 10 pounds each that are within range.  Each object then flies up to 150 feet in directions of your choice before falling to the ground.  If a projectile impacts a creature or object early, both the projectile and what it impacted receive 3d10 damage of a type appropriate for the projectile.  A creature in a projectileâ€™s path may make a dexterity saving throw to avoid it.

When the figment appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesnâ€™t have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the figment up to 80 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw.  A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.  A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell for the first time on its turn or ends its turn there.

After traveling 10 feet away from you, the orb stabilizes, and a jagged bolt of energy arcs off it toward each creature that it comes within 10 feet of as it travels. Each of these creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or receive 11d4+30 force damage.  Once the orb has traveled 60 feet, it fizzles into nothingness.  If the orb passes the same creature multiple times, energy only arcs toward it the first time.

Creatures of your choice within 20 feet of the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be hurled back 30 feet, landing prone.

Until the end of the target's next turn, it cannot be reduced below 1 hit point by any means, even [Wish](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz/OwlMarble-Magic/blob/master/spells/levels/10.md#wish).
