> ### Scribing a Spell
>
> **Copying a Spell into the Book**. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to a spellbook if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying a spell into a spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it.
>
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 1 hour and costs 25gp. The cost represent the fine inks you need to record it.
>
> **Copying from a Spell Scroll**. A spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
